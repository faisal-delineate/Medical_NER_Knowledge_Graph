This glycemic efficacy was associated with weight loss and a lower rate of clinically significant hypoglycemia. The effects of tirzepatide on glycemic control, weight loss, and other cardiometabolic parameters were consistent with other SURPASS trials.7-11 In the current trial, with an overall mean baseline HbA1c of8.8%,therecommendedHbA 1ctargetoflessthan7.0%was achieved by 68% of tirzepatide-treated participants.
