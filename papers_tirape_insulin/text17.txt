Boxplots represent observed HbA1c actual values over time for randomized patients from the pooled tirzepatide and insulin lispro groups, irrespective of treatment discontinuation or initiation of rescue therapy, using the full analysis set. The middle lines within each box represent the median observed HbA1c, the symbols in the boxes represent the mean observed HbA1c, the top and bottom of the boxes represent the interquartile range, the whiskers extend to the most extreme observed values with 1.5 times the IQR of the nearer quartile, and the symbols beyond these points represent the observed values outside that range. B, Lines show least-squares mean change from baseline in body weight over time, derived from a mixed-model repeated measures analysis (efficacy estimand).
