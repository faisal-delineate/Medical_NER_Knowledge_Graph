A total of 89% of participants completed trial treatment (87%-92% across tirzepatide groups and 87% in the insulin lispro group) (Figure 1). The leading cause of premature treatment discontinuation with tirzepa- tide was adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) (eTable 6 inSupplement 2). Primary Outcome For the treatment-regimen estimand, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.8% (73 mmol/mol), the pooled tirzepatide group demonstratedameanchangeinHbA 1c of−2.1%vs−1.1%with insulin lispro, with a mean HbA1c at week 52 of 6.7% vs 7.7% (Figure2A;eFigure3Ain Supplement2).Thepooledtirzepa- tidegroupwasstatisticallysuperiortoinsulinlispro,withan estimatedtreatmentdifferenceof−0.98%(95%CI,−1.17%to −0.79%;P < .001)(Table2). Key Secondary Outcomes At week 52, from a baseline HbA1c of 8.8% (73 mmol/mol), the mean changes in HbA1c were −1.9% with 5-mg tirzepa- tide, −2.2% with 10-mg tirzepatide, and −2.3% with 15-mg tirzepatide (Table 2).
