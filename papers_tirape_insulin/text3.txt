 To assess any difference in treatment response based on gly- cemic status, a subgroup analysis was conducted for the HbA1c based on baseline HbA1c category (≤8.5% or >8.5%) to test for any treatment × subgroup interaction at week 52. Exploratory end points not included in the original pro- tocol were change in insulin dose, the percentage of partici- pants achieving an HbA1c target of 5.7% or less, the percent- age of participants with weight loss of 10% or more, and the percentageofparticipantswithweightlossof15%ormore. Safetyassessmentsincludedadverseevents,treatmentdis- continuation due to adverse events, independently adjudi- catedpancreatitis,hypersensitivityreactions,vitalsigns,and hypoglycemiaevents(eAppendixinSupplement2). Throughout, to convert glucose from mg/dL to mmol/L, multiplyvaluesby0.0555.ToconvertHbA 1ctommol/mol,use thefollowingequation:10.93 × HbA1c − 23.50. Sample Size Calculation This trial was designed with a planned sample size of 1182 participants randomized in a 1:1:1:3 ratio to receive 5-mg tirzepatide, 10-mg tirzepatide, 15-mg tirzepatide, and insulin lispro to provide 80% power to show noninferiority of each tirzepatide dose vs insulin lispro with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c at week 52. Power was assessed assuming a 1-sided significance level of .025 using a 2-samplet test with a noninferiority margin of 0.3% and an SD of 1.3% and assuming no difference in HbA1c between treatment groups. This sample size ensured 97% power to achieve the pri- mary objective.
