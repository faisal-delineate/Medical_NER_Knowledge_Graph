In a similarly de- signed trial for semaglutide, 1 mg, the mean change in HbA1c wasâˆ’1.5%,withmeanweightlossof4.1kgandreductionsin dailybasalinsulinusefrom40IUto31IUatweek52.4 Higher insulin sparing observed with tirzepatide in the current trial compared with 1-mg semaglutide was likely due to greater weightlossandgreaterimprovementsininsulinsensitivity.4,5 However,directcomparisonofthesetrialsshouldbemadewith caution,andsemaglutide,2mg,isnowthehighestapproved doseforglycemiccontrol. Sustained weight loss of more than 10% has disease- modifying effects and possible remission of type 2 diabetes, likely improving long-term microvascular and cardiovascu- larmorbidityandmortality. 1,13Weightlossof5%ormorewas achievedby72%ofparticipantsinthetirzepatidegroupatweek 52 compared with 10% in the prandial lispro group and was accompanied by clinically relevant improvements in cardio- metabolicparameters.Inanexploratoryanalysis,weightloss of 10% or more was achieved by 32% to 57% of tirzepatide- treatedparticipantsatweek52.
