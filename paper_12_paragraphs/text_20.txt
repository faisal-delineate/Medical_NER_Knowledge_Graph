In exploratory analyses, the estimates of coefficients were posi- tive and there was a significant association between Cmax of Figure 3. Pharmacokinetics of semaglutide after the 10th dosing (a) Geometric mean plasma concentration-time profile of semaglutide. Dotted line indicates LLOQ. Values below LLOQ were imputed (see Supplementary Online Material). (b) Comparison of AUC0–24h and Cmax for semaglutide between the oral semaglutide and oral semaglutide plus omeprazole groups. Bars are estimated means and 95% confidence intervals. Treatment comparisons show estimated treatment ratio (oral semaglutide + omeprazole/oral semaglutide) and 90% confidence interval. AUC, area under the plasma concentration-time curve; Cmax, maximum semaglutide concentration; LLOQ, lower limit of quantification. EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG METABOLISM & TOXICOLOGY 873SNAC and pHmax,0– 3h on day 9; however, no statistical asso- ciation was found between C max of SNAC on day 10 and pHmax,0– 3h on day 9.
