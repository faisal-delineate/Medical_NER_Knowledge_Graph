The primary endpoint, AUC 0−24h,semaglutide,Day10, was log- transformed and analyzed (SAS version 9.3) using an analysis of variance model with treatment group (two levels) and sex as fixed factors. This analysis was based on the full analysis set, which was defined as subjects who were randomized and exposed. The mean difference in log-transformed AUC0−24h, semaglutide,Day10 between the two groups was estimated and back-transformed to the original scale and presented as a ratio together with the corresponding two-sided 90%CI. The secondary endpoint of maximum observed plasma concentration for semaglutide after the 10th dosing (Cmax,sema- glutide,Day10) was analyzed similarly. Time to maximum sema- glutide concentration (tmax,semaglutide,Day10) and half-life of oral semaglutide (t ½,semaglutide,Day10) were summarized using descriptive statistics. Relationships between three gastric pH parameters and the PK of semaglutide and SNAC were also explored.
