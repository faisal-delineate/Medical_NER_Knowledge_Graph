However, oral administration of GLP-1-based therapies will provide an alternative route of delivery and greater convenience for some patients with type 2 diabetes, and thereby may help with patient acceptance and adherence. The first orally delivered GLP-1 analog in clinical develop- ment for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is based on sema- glutide, a GLP-1 analog shown to be effective at improving glycemic control, reducing body weight, and potentially pro- viding cardiovascular protection in patients with type 2 dia- betes when administered subcutaneously [ 3,5,6]. Oral semaglutide comprises a co-formulation of semaglutide with the absorption enhancer, sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxylbenzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC), in a tablet [7]. The mode of action of SNAC involves a buffering effect that increases the local pH, protecting semaglutide against proteolytic degradation and facilitating the highly localized absorption of semaglutide across gastric mucosa in a concentration-dependent manner via effects on transcellular pathways [8,9].
