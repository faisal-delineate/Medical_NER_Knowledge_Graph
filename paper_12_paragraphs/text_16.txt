There were no apparent differences in other baseline characteristics between treatment groups. Two subjects in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group were poor metabolizers with regards to CYP2C19 phenotyping, while all other subjects were extensive metabolizers. 3.1. Semaglutide pharmacokinetics The geometric mean concentration-time profiles of semaglu- tide for one dosing interval (24 h) after the 10th dose are shown in Figure 3(a). Exposure to semaglutide after the 10th dose (AUC0â€“ 24h,semaglutide,Day10) appeared to be slightly higher EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG METABOLISM & TOXICOLOGY 871in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group compared with oral semaglutide alone; however, the increase was not statis- tically significant (estimated treatment ratio 1.13; 90%CI 0.88, 1.45) (Figure 3(b)). Similarly, Cmax,semaglutide,Day10 appeared to be slightly higher with oral semaglutide plus omeprazole compared with oral semaglutide alone, but the difference was not statistically significant (Figure 3(b)). Median tmax,sema- glutide,Day10 was the same in subjects receiving oral semaglu- tide plus omeprazole and in those receiving oral semaglutide alone (1.0 h for both groups) (Table 2).
