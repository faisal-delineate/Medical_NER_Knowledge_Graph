In a phase 2 dosage- finding trial in 632 patients with type 2 diabetes, once-daily oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control and greater weight loss than placebo over 26 weeks [7]. As the enhanced absorption of semaglutide is facilitated by SNAC in a pH-dependent manner, it is important to determine if treatments that change gastric pH influence the effects of SNAC and thereby alter the exposure to semaglutide. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a commonly used approach to alleviate symptoms of various gastrointestinal comorbidities in patients with type 2 diabetes. These agents act by inhibiting the acid pump in parietal cells of the stomach to increase gastric pH [10], with the largest decreases in acid secretion occurring around 2 h after administration [11,12]. The inhibi- tory effect on acid secretion increases with repeated once- daily dosing, reaching a plateau after 4 days [12]. The current trial was conducted in order to investigate whether administration of the commonly prescribed PPI, ome- prazole, affects the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral semaglutide. CONTACT Tine A.
