A structural analog of SNAC was used as an internal standard. The analysis was conducted using an AB SCIEX API 4000TM Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer and negative ions monitored in the MRM mode with mass transitions m/z 278.1→118.0 Da (SNAC) and m/z 249.0→135.0 Da (internal standard). The LC system was a Cohesive Turbulent Flow system with LC loading column, Turboflow Cyclone-P, 50 × 0.5 mm, and analytical column OnyxTM Monolithic C18, 50 × 2.0 mm. Quantification was performed using the peak area ratios of SNAC compared to the internal standard. The calibration curve was fitted by a weighted linear regression (1/concentration2). The LLOQ for SNAC was 5.00 ng/mL (see Supplementary Online Material for rules on imputation of values below the LLOQ). Omeprazole is completely metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP), particularly CYP2C19, and CYP2C19 is also inhibited by omeprazole [16]. CYP2C19 genotyping was con- ducted on blood samples, using validated sequencing assays and the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer or PGM Ion TorrentTM (Life Technologies).
