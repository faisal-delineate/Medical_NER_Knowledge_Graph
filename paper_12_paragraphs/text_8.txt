Subjects were stra- tified by sex and randomized (1:1) to oral semaglutide once- daily (5 mg for 5 days, followed by 10 mg for 5 days), either with or without concomitant administration of omeprazole 40 mg gastro-resistant capsules once-daily (Figure 1) using randomization lists. The 10-day dosing regimen was chosen to avoid subjects with semaglutide exposure below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and reduce the variability observed in exposure after a single dose [15]. In addition, the multiple dose regimen ensured a maximal effect on acid secretion. After oral administration of omeprazole, the onset of the anti-secretory effect occurs within 1 h, with the maximum effect from 2 h after dosing [12]. To investigate the exposure of semaglutide and SNAC at the time of the expected max- imum effect of omeprazole on gastric pH, oral semaglutide was dosed 2 h after intake of omeprazole in the current trial.
