The most frequently reported TEAEs with semaglutide were gastrointestinal disorders, which are considered a class effect of GLP-1RAs. No serious TEAEs, deaths, or hypo- glycemic episodes were reported. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, there was a slight non-statistically significant increase in semaglutide exposure when oral semaglutide was administered with omeprazole at the time of maximum anti- secretory effect. This is considered non-clinically relevant and, Table 3. Gastric pH parameters after the 9th dosing.
