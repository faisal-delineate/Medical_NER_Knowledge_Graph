The slight, apparent increase in exposure to semaglutide with omepra- zole was not considered to be clinically relevant, as semaglu- tide has a broad therapeutic index and the change was well within the margins defined by the FDA and EMA for moderate inhibition [13,14]. Data from the phase 2 study, where oral semaglutide from 2.5 mg to 40 mg once-daily was studied, indicate that oral semaglutide is clinically effective and well tolerated in a broad range of doses and exposures [7] and, as such, slight increases in exposure are unlikely to affect the clinical outcomes or safety profile of oral semaglutide in patients treated with a PPI. Gastric pH reaches its lowest levels during fasting (pH 1– 2) and highest after food intake (up to pH 4), with omeprazole increasing both the fasting and fed gastric pH levels [17,18]. To maximize the inhibition of proton pumps on gastric parietal cells, and thus the inhibitory effects on acid secretion, PPIs are typically taken 20– 30 min before meals. However, while this dosing might result in a maximal clinical anti-secretory effect, the purpose of this trial was to test the effect of an increased pH. Thus, in the present trial, omeprazole was dosed 2 h before oral semaglutide so that the time of oral semaglutide tablet disintegration coincided with the expected peak anti-secretory effect of omeprazole.
