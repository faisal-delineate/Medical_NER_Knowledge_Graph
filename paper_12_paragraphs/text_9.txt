Both trial products were administered with 120 mL of water. In subjects not receiving omeprazole, 120 mL of water was given alone 2 h before semaglutide administration. Subjects did not consume food or liquid other than water 6 h prior to dosing of semaglutide. No water intake was permitted in the 2 h before dosing of semaglutide. Subjects were not permitted food or liquid intake for 30 min after dosing of oral semaglutide, after which a meal was served. Blood samples were drawn into K3EDTA tubes pre-dose on day 1, and at set time points on days 9 and 10, for determination of plasma semaglutide and SNAC concentra- tions (see Supplementary Online Material for exact timings), and stored at – 20°C until analyzed. To determine plasma semaglutide concentrations, a liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) assay was used following precipitation of the plasma proteins (vali- dated according to current guidelines for bioanalysis of plasma samples in the concentration range 0.729 to 60.8 nmol/L [3.00 to 250 ng/mL], including extension of the assay range 5-fold by dilution) (Celerion Switzerland AG, Fehraltorf, Switzerland).
