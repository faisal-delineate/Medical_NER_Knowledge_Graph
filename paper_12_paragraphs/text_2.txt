Hansena aNovo Nordisk A/S, Søborg, Denmark;bPAREXEL International GmbH, Berlin, Germany ABSTRACT Background: Since the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 analog comprises semaglutide co-formulated with an absorption enhancer, sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate, which induces a transient, localized increase in gastric pH, we have investigated whether a proton pump inhibitor affects the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide. Research design and methods: A single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial investi- gated pharmacokinetic interactions of oral semaglutide with omeprazole (40 mg once-daily) in 54 healthy subjects.
