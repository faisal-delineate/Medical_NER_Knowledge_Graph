In addition, t½ for semaglutide was similar in subjects treated with oral semaglu- tide plus omeprazole (geometric mean of 156 h) and those treated with oral semaglutide alone (150 h) (Table 2). Results for semaglutide PK parameters after the 9th dosing (Supplemental Table S1) at the time of gastric pH measure- ment were consistent with results obtained after the 10 th dosing, the time of primary PK endpoint assessment. 3.2. SNAC pharmacokinetics As shown inFigure 4(a), the pattern of exposure to SNAC was similar in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group com- pared with oral semaglutide alone after the 10 th dosing (Figure 4(a)). The AUC0– 24h,SNAC,Day10 of SNAC appeared to be slightly higher in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group compared with oral semaglutide alone (estimated treatment ratio 1.14; 90%CI 1.02, 1.27) (Figure 4(b)). The maximum expo- sure of SNAC (Cmax,SNAC,Day10) was similar and not significantly different between the two groups (estimated treatment ratio 0.96; 90%CI 0.72, 1.29) (Figure 4(b)).
