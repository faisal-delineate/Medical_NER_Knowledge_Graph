The area under the pH measurements-time curve from 0 to 3 h after the 9th daily dose of oral semaglutide divided by the actual time interval during which pH measurements were being taken (AUC0– 3h,pH,Day9/time) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The maximum observed pH measure- ment 0 to 3 h after the 9th oral semaglutide dose (pHmax, Day9) was derived as the maximum of all valid pH measure- ments within the time frame. The incremental area under the pH measurement-time curve from 0 to 3 h after the 9th oral semaglutide dose divided by the actual time interval during which pH measurements were being taken (iAUC0– 3h,pH,Day9/ time) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method as the area under the pH measurement-time curve that is above the pre-dose pH average, taken as the average of pH values 5 min up to dosing at nominal time– 2 h in relation to the 9th dose. Safety was evaluated in all subjects who were exposed to at least one dose of trial product (safety analysis set).
