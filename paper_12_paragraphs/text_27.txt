Omeprazole inhibits its own CYP2C19-mediated metabo- lism and poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 have been shown to have higher gastric pH after treatment with omeprazole com- pared to extensive metabolizers [20]. In the present trial, there appeared to be no association between gastric pH, exposure to semaglutide, and CYP2C19 metabolizer status. Limitations of the current trial include that any direct effects of omeprazole on the pharmacodynamics of oral s e m a g l u t i d ew e r en o te l u c i d a ted. Another possible limita- tion is the open-label design; however, the design is in line with FDA and EMA guidelines on drug-drug interaction studies [13,14]. The open-label design is unlikely to have affected interpretation of PK endpoints, especially with all doses being administered on site, although this could have influenced the reporting of adverse events. Nevertheless, the safety profile of oral semaglutide was consistent with trials assessing oral and subcutaneous semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes [ 5– 7,21– 24]a n dd i dn o t appear to be affected by omeprazole co-administration.
