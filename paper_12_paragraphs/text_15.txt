Safety was assessed by the number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), number of hypoglycemic episodes, changes in laboratory safety variables, physical examination, vital signs, and electrocardiogram. 3. Results In total, 114 subjects were screened, and 54 subjects were randomized and exposed to trial products (Figure 2). Of these subjects, 53 completed the trial; one subject withdrew due to a TEAE (acute tonsillitis). All 54 subjects were included in the full analysis and safety analysis set. Demographic and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the subjects was 52 years in the oral semaglutide group and 59 years in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group.
