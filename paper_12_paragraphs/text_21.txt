There were no other statistically sig- nificant associations between AUC 0â€“ 24h or Cmax (day 9 and 10) for SNAC and the gastric pH parameters measured (Supplemental Table S3). 3.4. Safety and tolerability A total of 74 TEAEs were reported by 27 subjects (50%) across the two treatment groups (39 events in 17 subjects in the oral semaglutide group and 35 events in 10 subjects in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group). All of the TEAEs were mild (62 events) or moderate (12 events) in severity and all were reported as recovered. The most frequently reported TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (29 events in 17 sub- jects), including nausea and abdominal distension, followed by metabolism and nutrition disorders (12 events in 12 subjects), particularly decreased appetite (Supplemental Table S4). One subject treated with oral semaglutide alone withdrew due to a non-serious TEAE (acute tonsillitis). No serious TEAEs or deaths were reported. No medical events of special interest (pancrea- tic neoplasms, pancreatitis or clinical suspicion of pancreatitis, or medication errors concerning trial products) were reported. Table 2.
