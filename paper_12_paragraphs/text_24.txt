Few drug-drug inter- action studies have previously been published with omeprazole and other GLP-1RAs due to their subcutaneous administration. However, due to the mechanism of action of SNAC in oral sema- glutide, the present trial was conducted to investigate the poten- tial influence of omeprazole-mediated gastric pH increase on the systemic exposure of semaglutide and SNAC. As expected, gastric pH increased with omeprazole admin- istration. Omeprazole administration appeared to have no substantial impact on the exposure of SNAC. The AUC0– 24h, Day10 of SNAC was 14% higher in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group compared with semaglutide alone, although Cmax and tmax for SNAC were similar between the groups. Omeprazole treatment was associated with a slight but not statistically significant increase in exposure to sema- glutide (AUC0– 24h,Day10 and Cmax,Day10) versus oral semaglutide taken alone. Furthermore, median tmax and t½ appeared simi- lar in subjects treated with oral semaglutide plus omeprazole and those treated with oral semaglutide alone.
