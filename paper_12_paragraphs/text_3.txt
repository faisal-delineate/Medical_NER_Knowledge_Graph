Primary endpoints were area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 24 h for semaglu- tide (AUC0−24h,semaglutide,Day10) and maximum concentration of semaglutide (Cmax,semaglutide,Day10) at day 10. Results: Exposure of semaglutide appeared to be slightly increased, although not statistically signifi- cantly, with oral semaglutide plus omeprazole versus oral semaglutide alone (AUC0−24h,semaglutide,Day10 [estimated treatment ratio 1.13; 90%CI 0.88, 1.45] and Cmax,semaglutide,Day10 [estimated treatment ratio 1.16; 90%CI 0.90, 1.49]). Gastric pH was higher with oral semaglutide and omeprazole versus oral semaglutide alone. Adverse events were mild or moderate and, most commonly, gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusions: There was a slight non-statistically significant increase in semaglutide exposure when oral semaglutide was administered with omeprazole, but this is not considered clinically relevant and no dose adjustment is likely to be required.

Introduction The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor represents a valuable target for the management of type 2 diabetes, based on its abilities to stimulate insulin, inhibit glucagon secretion in a glucose-depending manner, delay gastric emp- tying, and reduce energy intake with a low risk of hypoglyce- mia [1,2], and the potential for cardiovascular protection [3,4]. Several GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are available (lir- aglutide, lixisenatide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, and exenatide) and are administered by subcutaneous injection on a daily or weekly basis.
