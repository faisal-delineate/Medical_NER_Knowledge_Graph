Results for SNAC PK parameters after the 9 th dosing (Supplemental Table S1) were consistent with results obtained after the 10th dosing. 3.3. Effects on gastric pH parameters Overall, an increase in gastric pH was observed on day 9 in subjects in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group com- pared to the oral semaglutide alone group. The means of AUC0– 3h,pH,Day9/time, iAUC 0– 3h,pH,Day9/time, and pH max,Day9 appeared higher in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group compared with the oral semaglutide alone group (Table 3). Scatter plots presenting the association of semaglutide exposure (AUC0– 24h,Day9) and the gastric pH parameters did not indicate any pattern or relationship (linear or non-linear) between treatments (Supplemental Figure S1). The two CYP2C19 poor metabolizers w ere distributed across the plot similarly to the extensive metabolizers, without display- ing any specific pattern. In exploratory analyses, there were no statistically significant associations between AUC0– 24h or Cmax (day 9 and 10) for semaglutide and the gastric pH parameters measured (Suppl emental Table S2). Scatter plots presenting the association of SNAC exposure (AUC 0– 24h,Day9) and the gastric pH parameters did not appear to show a specific pattern (Su pplemental Figure S2).
