Bars are estimated means and 95% confidence intervals. Treatment comparisons show estimated treatment ratio (oral semaglutide + omeprazole/oral semaglutide) and 90% confidence interval. AUC, area under the plasma concentration-time curve; Cmax, maximum SNAC concentration; SNAC, sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate. 874 T. A. BÃ†KDAL ET AL.No hypoglycemic episodes were reported during the trial. No clinically relevant changes in vital signs, laboratory parameters, physical examination, or electrocardiogram were observed. Pulse rate increased comparably in both treatment groups and changes were not considered clinically relevant at an individual level. 4. Discussion To facilitate absorption upon oral administration, semaglutide has been co-formulated with SNAC, which induces a localized, transi- ent increase in gastric pH, protecting semaglutide from proteolytic degradation and enhancing absorption [8,9].
