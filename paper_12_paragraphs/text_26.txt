Although this regimen might not be representative of omeprazole and oral semaglutide dosing in clinical practice, which is a potential limita- tion of our trial, the dosing schedule was selected to reflect a worst-case scenario that produced the potential maximum effect of omeprazole on the PK of oral semaglutide. We also selected a relatively high dose of omeprazole 40 mg/day, which is indicated for the treatment of gastric ulcers [12]. Thus, administration of omeprazole to a different schedule or dose with oral semaglutide in real life is unlikely to influence semaglutide exposure to a greater degree than that reported here. In the present trial, omeprazole was administered with 120 mL of water. Although the potential effect of this water consumption on semaglutide exposure was not compared with a complete fasting state, a previous study had indicated that semaglutide exposure was not significantly affected by water volume [19].
