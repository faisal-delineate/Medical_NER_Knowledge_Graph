The median tmax,SNAC,Day10 for SNAC after the 10th daily dose was similar between the groups (0.7 h with oral semaglu- tide and 0.6 h with oral semaglutide plus omeprazole) Figure 2. Subject flow.

A. BÆKDAL ET AL.(Table 2). No clear terminal phase was observed for SNAC; hence, t½ could not be estimated. However, the mean con- centration of SNAC in plasma had declined to less than LLOQ in most patients within 24 h, indicating fast elimination.
