Gastric pH measurements were performed on day−1 and day 9 (to prevent the pH measurement procedure from influ- encing semaglutide absorption and exposure on day 10 [pri- mary endpoint timepoint]). A pH catheter was inserted into the stomach via a nostril and the ZepHr ® Impedance/pH Reflux Monitoring System was used. The pH measurements were started at the time of omeprazole dosing (day 9, oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group) or at least 5 min before intake of 120 mL water in patients not receiving omeprazole (day – 1 and day 9; oral semaglutide group), and pH measure- ments were recorded every 5 s for 5 h. 2.3. Sample size and statistical methods The sample size was based on the precision of the ratio for the primary endpoint, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for semaglutide from time 0 to 24 h after the 10th dosing (AUC0−24h,semaglutide,Day10), between the two treatment groups using a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) derived from the t-distribution. With 24 evaluable profiles at end of treatment in each of the groups, assuming a standard devia- tion for log (AUC0−24h,semaglutide,Day10) of 0.6 and no difference between males and females, there was at least 80% probabil- ity to get a 95%CI for the ratio R of AUC0– 24h,semaglutide,Day10 between the two treatment groups within (0.68*R; 1.46*R). Assuming a withdrawal rate of 10%, 54 subjects were planned for randomization (27 per group).
