A stable isotope-labeled analog of semaglutide was used as an internal standard. The analysis was conducted using an AB SCIEX API QTRAP® 5500 mass spectrometer and positive ions were monitored in the multi- ple reaction-monitoring mode with mass transitions m/z 1029.1→136.0 Da (semaglutide) and m/z 1033.2 →136.0 Da (internal standard). The liquid chromatography (LC) system was a Waters ACQUITY UPLC System and the LC column an ACQUITY UPLC BEH300 C18, 2.1 × 50 mm. Quantification was performed by peak area ratios of semaglutide compared to the internal standard. The calibration curve was fitted by a Figure 1. Trial design. PK, pharmacokinetics. 870 T. A.

For the bioanalysis of SNAC, an LC-MS/MS assay was used following in-line solid-phase sample preparation (validated according to current guidelines for bioanalysis of plasma sam- ples in the concentration range 5.00 to 2000 ng/mL, including extension of the assay range 5-fold by dilution) (Celerion Switzerland AG, Fehraltorf, Switzerland).
