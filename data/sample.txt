Baseline Characteristics
This trial was conducted between October 19, 2020, and November 1, 2022. A total of 2267 participants were assessed for eligibility; 1428 participants were randomized, and 1425 received at least one dose of the study treatment (Figure 1).

Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar across groups:
- Mean age: 59 years
- Women: 824 participants (58%)
- Mean diabetes duration: 14 years
- Mean HbA1c: 8.8%
- Mean body weight: 90.5 kg
- Mean fasting serum glucose: 157 mg/dL
- Median insulin glargine dose: 46 IU/day (0.53 IU/kg/day)

Racial and ethnic representation within the US included 13% Black and 53% Hispanic participants.

A total of 89% of participants completed the trial treatment (ranging from 87%–92% across tirzepatide groups and 87% in the insulin lispro group, Figure 1). The leading cause of premature treatment discontinuation for tirzepatide was adverse events, primarily gastrointestinal issues (eTable 6 in Supplement 2).

Primary Outcome
For the treatment-regimen estimand:
- From a baseline mean HbA1c of 8.8% (73 mmol/mol), the pooled tirzepatide group showed a mean HbA1c reduction of −2.1% versus −1.1% with insulin lispro.
- At week 52, the mean HbA1c was 6.7% in the tirzepatide group versus 7.7% in the insulin lispro group (Figure 2A, eFigure 3A in Supplement 2).
- Tirzepatide was statistically superior to insulin lispro, with an estimated treatment difference of −0.98% (95% CI: −1.17% to −0.79%; *P* < .001) (Table 2).

Key Secondary Outcomes
At week 52, baseline HbA1c reductions were as follows:
- −1.9% with 5 mg tirzepatide
- −2.2% with 10 mg tirzepatide
- −2.3% with 15 mg tirzepatide

Tirzepatide was statistically superior to insulin lispro for all doses:
- 5 mg: −0.79% (95% CI: −1.01% to −0.56%; *P* < .001)
- 10 mg: −1.01% (95% CI: −1.26% to −0.77%; *P* < .001)
- 15 mg: −1.13% (95% CI: −1.37% to −0.90%; *P* < .001)

Observed HbA1c values over time for individual tirzepatide doses are shown in eFigure 4A in Supplement 2. A target HbA1c of less than 7.0% was achieved in:
- 68% of tirzepatide-treated participants (483 of 716)
- 36% of insulin lispro-treated participants (256 of 708) (Table 2; eFigure 3B in Supplement 2).

Body Weight Changes
From a mean baseline body weight of 90 kg:
- The pooled estimated mean change in body weight was −9.0 kg with tirzepatide versus −3.2 kg with insulin lispro at week 52 (Figure 2B, eFigure 3C in Supplement 2).
- Mean weight reductions were:
- −6.7 kg with 5 mg tirzepatide
- −9.2 kg with 10 mg tirzepatide
- −11.0 kg with 15 mg tirzepatide

All tirzepatide doses were superior to insulin lispro (Table 2). Observed weight changes over time are presented in eFigure 4B in Supplement 2.

Additional Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints
Greater reductions in fasting serum glucose were observed with all tirzepatide doses compared to insulin lispro at week 52 (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).

Reductions in mean daily 2-hour postprandial glucose from the 7-point self-monitored blood glucose profile ranged from:
- 65 to 78 mg/dL with tirzepatide
- 65 mg/dL with insulin lispro (eFigure 5 in Supplement 2).

An HbA1c target of ≤6.5% was achieved in:
- 56% of tirzepatide-treated participants
- 22% of insulin lispro-treated participants

An exploratory HbA1c target of <5.7% was achieved in:
- 18% of tirzepatide-treated participants
- 3% of insulin lispro-treated participants (eTable 7 and eFigure 3B in Supplement 2).

For the efficacy estimand, more participants achieved a composite endpoint of an HbA1c value of <7.
