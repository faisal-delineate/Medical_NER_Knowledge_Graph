Findings In this randomized clinical trial (N = 1428), mean change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 52 was −2.1% with tirzepatide vs −1.1% with insulin lispro; treatment differences were statistically significant with less hypoglycemia and more body weight reduction with tirzepatide. Meaning Adding once-weekly tirzepatide vs prandial insulin lispro to insulin glargine in basal insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control resulted in greater reductions in HbA1c along with more weight loss and less hypoglycemia.
