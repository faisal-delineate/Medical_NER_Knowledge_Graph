Insulin lispro was initiated at 4 IU prior to the 3 largest mealsoftheday.Doseswereadjustedtwiceweeklyuntilweek Key Points Question What is the effect on glycemic control of adding once-weekly tirzepatide vs thrice-daily prandial insulin lispro to insulin glargine treatment in inadequately controlled basal insulin–treated type 2 diabetes? Findings In this randomized clinical trial (N = 1428), mean change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 52 was −2.1% with tirzepatide vs −1.1% with insulin lispro; treatment differences were statistically significant with less hypoglycemia and more body weight reduction with tirzepatide. Meaning Adding once-weekly tirzepatide vs prandial insulin lispro to insulin glargine in basal insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control resulted in greater reductions in HbA1c along with more weight loss and less hypoglycemia.

At randomization, participants reduced insulin glargine dosesby30%inallgroupstolowerhypoglycemiariskdueto study treatment initiation. Basal insulin glargine doses were titrated weekly to a prebreakfast blood glucose target of 100 to125mg/dL(eTable4inSupplement2).Tirzepatide-treated participants were restricted from any up-titration of insulin glarginefor4weeksafterrandomization. Outcomes The primary objective was to demonstrate statistical nonin- feriority of tirzepatide (pooled cohort) to insulin lispro in change from baseline in HbA1c. Key secondary objectives, controlled for type I error (described in a graphical testing scheme in eAppendix inSupplement 2), included demon- strating statistical superiority of tirzepatide (pooled cohort) to insulin lispro in change from baseline in HbA1c and body weight and percentage of participants reaching HbA1c less than 7.0% at week 52; demonstrating statistical noninferior- ity of individual tirzepatide doses (5 mg, 10 mg and/or 15 mg) to insulin lispro in change in HbA1c from baseline to week 52; and demonstrating statistical superiority of individual tirz- epatide doses (5 mg, 10 mg and/or 15 mg) to insulin lispro in change in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 52 (eAppendix and eFigure 2 inSupplement 2). Other secondary end points not controlled for type I error were the percentage of participants achieving an HbA1c target of 6.5% or less, the percentage of participants with weight loss of 5% or greater, mean change from baseline in fasting serum glucose, daily mean 7-point self-monitored blood glucose levels, lipid lev- els, body mass index, and waist circumference. A composite end point of an HbA1c level less than 7.0% without clinically significant hypoglycemia events (defined as blood glucose level <54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia) was also assessed. To assess any difference in treatment response based on gly- cemic status, a subgroup analysis was conducted for the HbA1c based on baseline HbA1c category (≤8.5% or >8.5%) to test for any treatment × subgroup interaction at week 52. Exploratory end points not included in the original pro- tocol were change in insulin dose, the percentage of partici- pants achieving an HbA1c target of 5.7% or less, the percent- age of participants with weight loss of 10% or more, and the percentageofparticipantswithweightlossof15%ormore. Safetyassessmentsincludedadverseevents,treatmentdis- continuation due to adverse events, independently adjudi- catedpancreatitis,hypersensitivityreactions,vitalsigns,and hypoglycemiaevents(eAppendixinSupplement2).

Sample Size Calculation This trial was designed with a planned sample size of 1182 participants randomized in a 1:1:1:3 ratio to receive 5-mg tirzepatide, 10-mg tirzepatide, 15-mg tirzepatide, and insulin lispro to provide 80% power to show noninferiority of each tirzepatide dose vs insulin lispro with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c at week 52. Power was assessed assuming a 1-sided significance level of .025 using a 2-samplet test with a noninferiority margin of 0.3% and an SD of 1.3% and assuming no difference in HbA1c between treatment groups. This sample size ensured 97% power to achieve the pri- mary objective. Statistical Analyses Primaryandkeysecondaryendpointswereevaluatedfor2es- timands (treatment-regimen estimand and efficacy esti- mand).TypeIerrorratewascontrolledwithineachestimand forevaluationofprimaryandkeysecondaryobjectivesusing agraphicalapproach(eAppendixinSupplement2).Forother secondaryandexploratoryendpoints,theefficacyestimand wasevaluatedunlessspecifiedotherwise.Safetyanalyseswere performedonallrandomizedpatientswhoreceivedatleast1 doseofthestudydrugwithalldatafromstartofstudytreat- ment to end of safety follow-up. All treatment difference re- sultsfromstatisticalanalyseswereaccompaniedwith2-sided 95%CIsandP values,withstatisticalsignificancedefinedas P < .05.AllstatisticalanalyseswereperformedusingSAS,ver- sion9.4(SASInstitute). The treatment-regimen estimand evaluated the treat- ment effect of tirzepatide relative to insulin lispro irrespec- tive of adherence to investigational product or introduction of rescue therapy. Statistical models used data during the treatment period regardless of treatment adherence or use of rescue therapy in participants who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment and did not discontinue study treatment duetoinadvertentenrollment.Forcontinuousendpoints,an analysis of covariance model with treatment, country, base- line metformin use (yes or no), and baseline HbA1c (≤8.5% or >8.5%; excluding HbA1c end point) as fixed effects and base- line end point value as a covariate was used. For categorical end points, after missing data imputation, logistic regression with the same fixed effects and covariate as continuous end points was used. The efficacy estimand evaluated the treatment effect of tirzepatide treatments relative to insulin lispro if all patients had adhered to treatment and had not received rescue therapy. Statistical models used data during the treatment period excluding data after initiating rescue therapy or early discontinuation of the study drug in participants receiving at least 1 dose of study treatment who did not discontinue study treatment due to inadvertent enrollment. Continuous end points used a mixed model for repeated measures on the efficacy analysis set with treatment, visit, treatment × visit interaction, country, baseline metformin use (yes or no), and baseline HbA1c category (≤8.5% or >8.5%; excluding HbA1c endpoint)asfixedeffectsandbaselineendpointvalue as a covariate. For categorical end points, after missing data imputation, logistic regression was used with the same factors and covariate (excluding visit effects) as continuous end points.

Overall, 2267 participants were assessed for trial eligibility, 1428 participants were randomized, and 1425 participants received at least 1 dose of the study treat- ment (Figure 1). Baseline demographics and clinical charac- teristics were similar across groups (overall mean age, 59 years; 824 [58%] women; mean diabetes duration, 14 years; mean HbA1c, 8.8%; mean body weight, 90.5 kg; mean fast- ing serum glucose, 157 mg/dL; and median insulin glargine dose, 46 IU/d [0.53 IU/kg/d]) (Table 1;e T a b l e5i nSupple- ment 2). Racial and ethnic groups within the US were well represented (13% of participants were Black and 53% were Hispanic). A total of 89% of participants completed trial treatment (87%-92% across tirzepatide groups and 87% in the insulin lispro group) (Figure 1). The leading cause of premature treatment discontinuation with tirzepa- tide was adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) (eTable 6 inSupplement 2). Primary Outcome For the treatment-regimen estimand, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.8% (73 mmol/mol), the pooled tirzepatide group demonstratedameanchangeinHbA 1c of−2.1%vs−1.1%with insulin lispro, with a mean HbA1c at week 52 of 6.7% vs 7.7% (Figure2A;eFigure3Ain Supplement2).Thepooledtirzepa- tidegroupwasstatisticallysuperiortoinsulinlispro,withan estimatedtreatmentdifferenceof−0.98%(95%CI,−1.17%to −0.79%;P < .001)(Table2). Key Secondary Outcomes At week 52, from a baseline HbA1c of 8.8% (73 mmol/mol), the mean changes in HbA1c were −1.9% with 5-mg tirzepa- tide, −2.2% with 10-mg tirzepatide, and −2.3% with 15-mg tirzepatide (Table 2).

Observed HbA1c values over time with individual tirzepatide doses are presented in eFig- u r e4 Ai nSupplement 2. Target HbA1c of less than 7.0% was achieved in 68% of tirzepatide-treated participants (483 of 716) vs 36% receiving insulin lispro (256 of 708) (Table 2; eFigure 3B inSupplement 2).

This glycemic efficacy was associated with weight loss and a lower rate of clinically significant hypoglycemia. The effects of tirzepatide on glycemic control, weight loss, and other cardiometabolic parameters were consistent with other SURPASS trials.7-11 In the current trial, with an overall mean baseline HbA1c of8.8%,therecommendedHbA 1ctargetoflessthan7.0%was achieved by 68% of tirzepatide-treated participants.

Itispossiblethatthebodyweightlossinducedbytirzepa- tide therapy and its reported effect in reducing liver fat content12mayhaveledtoanimprovementininsulinsensitiv- ity and decreased insulin requirements. In a similarly de- signed trial for semaglutide, 1 mg, the mean change in HbA1c was−1.5%,withmeanweightlossof4.1kgandreductionsin dailybasalinsulinusefrom40IUto31IUatweek52.4 Higher insulin sparing observed with tirzepatide in the current trial compared with 1-mg semaglutide was likely due to greater weightlossandgreaterimprovementsininsulinsensitivity.4,5 However,directcomparisonofthesetrialsshouldbemadewith caution,andsemaglutide,2mg,isnowthehighestapproved doseforglycemiccontrol. Sustained weight loss of more than 10% has disease- modifying effects and possible remission of type 2 diabetes, likely improving long-term microvascular and cardiovascu- larmorbidityandmortality. 1,13Weightlossof5%ormorewas achievedby72%ofparticipantsinthetirzepatidegroupatweek 52 compared with 10% in the prandial lispro group and was accompanied by clinically relevant improvements in cardio- metabolicparameters.Inanexploratoryanalysis,weightloss of 10% or more was achieved by 32% to 57% of tirzepatide- treatedparticipantsatweek52. Hypoglycemia risk and the weight gain observed with complex insulin regimens that include prandial insulin have been main limitations to optimally up-titrate insulin therapy in clinical practice.3 In the current trial, the rate of clinically significant hypoglycemia was lower with tirzepatide vs insu- lin lispro add-on therapy, despite achieving lower HbA1c lev- els. All participants had reduced their basal insulin dose by 30% irrespective of baseline HbA1c, which differs from the common practice of reducing dose of basal insulin by 10%1 or 20%,11,14 only for people with HbA1c less than 8%, when adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The safety profile of tirzepa- tide was consistent with that reported previously in other SURPASS trials.7-11 This trial had several strengths. This was a global trial with a high completion rate. Titration of insulin, the per- centage of participants who reached titration goals, and the overall glycemic efficacy in the prandial lispro insulin group wereconsistentwithalargertrialthathadsimilarbloodglu- cose targets.4 Limitations This trial had limitations.
