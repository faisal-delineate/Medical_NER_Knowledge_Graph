 Basal insulin glargine doses were titrated weekly to a prebreakfast blood glucose target of 100 to125mg/dL(eTable4inSupplement2).Tirzepatide-treated participants were restricted from any up-titration of insulin glarginefor4weeksafterrandomization. Outcomes The primary objective was to demonstrate statistical nonin- feriority of tirzepatide (pooled cohort) to insulin lispro in change from baseline in HbA1c. Key secondary objectives, controlled for type I error (described in a graphical testing scheme in eAppendix inSupplement 2), included demon- strating statistical superiority of tirzepatide (pooled cohort) to insulin lispro in change from baseline in HbA1c and body weight and percentage of participants reaching HbA1c less than 7.0% at week 52; demonstrating statistical noninferior- ity of individual tirzepatide doses (5 mg, 10 mg and/or 15 mg) to insulin lispro in change in HbA1c from baseline to week 52; and demonstrating statistical superiority of individual tirz- epatide doses (5 mg, 10 mg and/or 15 mg) to insulin lispro in change in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 52 (eAppendix and eFigure 2 inSupplement 2). Other secondary end points not controlled for type I error were the percentage of participants achieving an HbA1c target of 6.5% or less, the percentage of participants with weight loss of 5% or greater, mean change from baseline in fasting serum glucose, daily mean 7-point self-monitored blood glucose levels, lipid lev- els, body mass index, and waist circumference. A composite end point of an HbA1c level less than 7.0% without clinically significant hypoglycemia events (defined as blood glucose level <54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia) was also assessed.
