 Boxplots represent observed changes from baseline in body weight over time for randomized patients from the pooled tirzepatide and insulin lispro groups, irrespective of treatment discontinuation or initiation of rescue therapy, using the full analysis set. The middle lines within each box represent the median observed changes from baseline; the symbols in the boxes represent the mean observed percentage change; the box tops and bottoms represent the interquartile range; the whiskers extend to the most extreme observed values with 1.5 times the IQR of the nearer quartile; and the symbols beyond these points represent the observed values outside that range.
