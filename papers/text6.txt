 For categorical end points, after missing data imputation, logistic regression with the same fixed effects and covariate as continuous end points was used. The efficacy estimand evaluated the treatment effect of tirzepatide treatments relative to insulin lispro if all patients had adhered to treatment and had not received rescue therapy. Statistical models used data during the treatment period excluding data after initiating rescue therapy or early discontinuation of the study drug in participants receiving at least 1 dose of study treatment who did not discontinue study treatment due to inadvertent enrollment. Continuous end points used a mixed model for repeated measures on the efficacy analysis set with treatment, visit, treatment × visit interaction, country, baseline metformin use (yes or no), and baseline HbA1c category (≤8.5% or >8.5%; excluding HbA1c endpoint)asfixedeffectsandbaselineendpointvalue as a covariate. For categorical end points, after missing data imputation, logistic regression was used with the same factors and covariate (excluding visit effects) as continuous end points.
