The treatment-regimen estimand evaluated the treat- ment effect of tirzepatide relative to insulin lispro irrespec- tive of adherence to investigational product or introduction of rescue therapy. Statistical models used data during the treatment period regardless of treatment adherence or use of rescue therapy in participants who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment and did not discontinue study treatment duetoinadvertentenrollment.Forcontinuousendpoints,an analysis of covariance model with treatment, country, base- line metformin use (yes or no), and baseline HbA1c (â‰¤8.5% or >8.5%; excluding HbA1c end point) as fixed effects and base- line end point value as a covariate was used.
