Hypoglycemia risk and the weight gain observed with complex insulin regimens that include prandial insulin have been main limitations to optimally up-titrate insulin therapy in clinical practice.3 In the current trial, the rate of clinically significant hypoglycemia was lower with tirzepatide vs insu- lin lispro add-on therapy, despite achieving lower HbA1c lev- els. All participants had reduced their basal insulin dose by 30% irrespective of baseline HbA1c, which differs from the common practice of reducing dose of basal insulin by 10%1 or 20%,11,14 only for people with HbA1c less than 8%, when adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The safety profile of tirzepa- tide was consistent with that reported previously in other SURPASS trials.7-11 This trial had several strengths. This was a global trial with a high completion rate.
