a To meet regulatory requirements, race and ethnicity were recorded in this study and were determined by the participant according to fixed selection categories. b Duration of diabetes was based on the first diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. c Normal value for HbA1c was <6.5%. To convert HbA1c values to mmol/mol, use the following equation: 10.93 × HbA1c − 23.50. d Normal value for fasting serum glucose was 74-106 mg/dL for those younger than 60 years and 82-115 mg/dL for those aged 60-90 years. e Normal value for eGFR was /H1135060 mL/min/1.73 m2. Participants with a baseline eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded from the study.
