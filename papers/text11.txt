Observed HbA1c values over time with individual tirzepatide doses are presented in eFig- u r e4 Ai nSupplement 2. Target HbA1c of less than 7.0% was achieved in 68% of tirzepatide-treated participants (483 of 716) vs 36% receiving insulin lispro (256 of 708) (Table 2; eFigure 3B inSupplement 2). From a mean baseline body weight of 90 kg, the pooled estimatedmeanchangeinbodyweightwas−9.0kgwithtirz- epatide vs 3.2 kg with insulin lispro at week 52 (Figure 2B; eFigure 3C inSupplement 2). Mean change in body weight was −6.7 kg for 5-mg tirzepatide, −9.2 kg for 10-mg tirzepa- tide, and −11.0 kg for 15-mg tirzepatide (Table 2). All tirzepa- tide doses demonstrated superiority to insulin lispro (Table 2). Observed changes from baseline in body weight over time with individual tirzepatide doses are presented in eFigure 4B inSupplement 2.
