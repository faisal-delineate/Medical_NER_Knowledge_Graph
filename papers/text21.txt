   There were no cases of adjudicated pancreatitis (Table 3). Reductions in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were observed with tirzepatide (eTable 14 inSupplement 2). Other laboratory measures are presented in eTable 14 inSupplement 2. Nine tirzepatide-treated par- ticipants and 2 insulin lispro–treated participants reported cholelithiasis (Table 3). No clinically relevant changes in mean calcitonin levels or cases of thyroid malignancies were reported. Two tirzepatide-treated participants and 4 insulin Table 2.
