1,What formula is used for eGFR calculation?,Easy,"ChronicKidney
 DiseaseEpidemiologyCollaboration
 equation)",Table 1,"The formula used for eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) calculation is the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. These formulas take into account factors such as serum creatinine levels, age, gender, and race to estimate the kidney function of an individual. The eGFR is an important measure in assessing kidney function and is used in the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic kidney disease. It is calculated using the following formula:

eGFR = 186 x (Creatinine^-1.154) x (Age^-0.203) x (0.742 if female) x (1.210 if Black)

Where eGFR is in mL/min/1.73mÂ², Creatinine is in mg/dL, and Age is in years. This formula provides an estimate of the glomerular filtration rate, which is a key indicator of kidney function. Proper assessment and monitoring of eGFR are essential in the management of kidney disease and related conditions."
2,How many participants experienced nausea in this study?,Easy,20,Table 3,"In this study, a total of 1 participant experienced nausea. This participant was on the once-weekly dosage of tirzepatide, which occurred during the trial. Nausea was reported as an adverse effect in this case."
3,What is the mean age of the insulin lispro group?,Easy,59,Table 1,"To determine the mean age of the insulin lispro group, we need to analyze the relationships between the different entities in the graph data provided. 

Firstly, the graph data shows that Insulin lispro is involved in a sponsored study and is compared with 4 IU, which is administered prior to the 3 largest meals of the day. This suggests that the Insulin lispro group consists of individuals who are using this type of insulin for glycemic control.

Additionally, the graph data indicates that glycemic control is similar to being administered once-weekly, which is supervised weekly. This implies that individuals in the Insulin lispro group may be receiving their insulin treatment once-weekly under the supervision of a healthcare provider.

Furthermore, once-weekly occurred during a trial involving tirzepatide, which has a conversion equation to being administered thrice-daily. This information does not directly relate to the mean age of the Insulin lispro group but provides context on the treatment regimen of individuals in the study.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the graph data, we can infer that the mean age of the Insulin lispro group cannot be determined solely from the relationships between the entities mentioned. Additional data on the age distribution of individuals in the Insulin lispro group would be needed to calculate the mean age accurately."
4,What was the primary outcome of the study?,Easy,HbA1c,Abstract,"The primary outcome of the study was to determine the efficacy of tirzepatide, a thrice-daily medication, on glycemic control in individuals with diabetes. This was compared with insulin lispro, 4 IU administered prior to the 3 largest meals of the day, as well as other dosing regimens such as 5mg once weekly and 2.5mg every 4 weeks. The study was sponsored and supervised over a period of 52 weeks and found that once-weekly dosing was similar to twice-weekly dosing in terms of glycemic control. Overall, the study aimed to assess the effectiveness of tirzepatide in managing blood sugar levels in diabetic patients."
5,What does each box in plot Fig 2A represent?,Easy,Interquartile range,Description of the graph,"Each box in plot Fig 2A represents a different aspect or relationship related to the use of insulin lispro in the context of a study or trial. The plot starts with the dosing regimen of 5mg once weekly, which is not related to the dosing regimen of 2.5mg every 4 weeks. The study conducted over 52 weeks was sponsored and involved the use of insulin lispro at a dose of 4 IU, which was compared with the dosing before the 3 largest meals of the day. This dosing schedule was found to be similar to a twice-weekly regimen supervised weekly, which was also similar to achieving glycemic control with a once-weekly dosing. The occurrence of glycemic control during the trial was predisposed to the use of tirzepatide, which required conversion from a thrice-daily dosing schedule. Each box represents a specific link or relationship in the chain of events related to the use of insulin lispro and its impact on glycemic control in the study setting."
6,"What was the dosing regimen of Tirzepatide in week 1 and week 52, respectively?",Medium,"In week 1 Tirzepatide dose was started as 2.5 mg for all the three groups once weekly. Randomised dose like 5mg, 10mg, 15mg was achieved for respective groups after 52 weeks.",In Methods part (Intervention),"In week 1, the dosing regimen of Tirzepatide was thrice-daily. In week 52, the dosing regimen of Tirzepatide was once-weekly."
7,What was the mean baseline body weight value used here?,Medium,91 kg,Fig 2 A,"The mean baseline body weight value used here cannot be determined from the given graph data. The data provided in the graph mainly consists of relationships between different medications, dosages, frequencies, and study parameters. The graph does not include specific numerical values for baseline body weight or any calculations that would allow us to determine the mean baseline body weight value.

To calculate the mean baseline body weight value, we would need actual numerical data on the baseline body weight of individual participants in a specific study or trial. This data is not provided in the given graph. The graph primarily focuses on the relationships between different elements in a study or trial related to diabetes management and medication use.

In conclusion, without specific baseline body weight data included in the graph, we cannot determine the mean baseline body weight value used in the context of the relationships and comparisons presented in the graph."
8,What is the COV_VAR_STAT of eGFR from Table 1?,Medium,SD,Table 1,"The COV_VAR_STAT of eGFR from Table 1 cannot be determined from the provided graph data. The graph data primarily consists of relationships between different medications, dosages, frequencies, and study designs, but it does not contain any information specifically related to eGFR or its variability. In order to calculate the COV_VAR_STAT of eGFR from Table 1, we would need numerical data related to eGFR values over a period of time, which is not present in the provided graph data."
9,What is the percentage of participants with type 2 DM in this paper?,Medium,100,Methods (Participants),"To determine the percentage of participants with type 2 DM in this paper, we need to look at the relationships between the different entities in the graph data provided. Unfortunately, the graph data does not directly provide information on the percentage of participants with type 2 DM. The relationships mentioned in the graph data are related to medication dosages, study sponsorship, insulin types, dosing schedules, and glycemic control.

Without specific information on the number of participants with type 2 DM in the study or trial mentioned in the graph data, it is not possible to calculate the percentage of participants with type 2 DM. The graph data primarily focuses on the relationships between different entities and their interactions within the context of the study or trial.

In order to determine the percentage of participants with type 2 DM in this paper, additional information such as the total number of participants in the study, the number of participants with type 2 DM, and their characteristics would be needed."
10,Which group showed the highest incidence of emergent adverse events?,Medium,All groups had different ADRs that sums upto 100%,Table 3,"The group that showed the highest incidence of emergent adverse events was the group receiving tirzepatide, as indicated by the relationship ""once-weekly -[OCCURRED_DURING_TRIAL]-> tirzepatide"" in the graph data. This group experienced adverse events during the trial involving tirzepatide, suggesting that this treatment may have a higher incidence of adverse events compared to other treatments or groups mentioned in the graph data."
11,What is the DV_STAT of Fig 2A?,Hard,Median,Description of the graph,"The DV_STAT of Fig 2A is ""glycemic control."" This can be determined by following the path in the graph data from ""week"" to ""glycemic control."" The relationship between these two variables is that ""week"" is similar to ""glycemic control,"" indicating that the DV_STAT of Fig 2A is related to or influenced by glycemic control. Glycemic control is predisposed to ""once-weekly,"" which occurred during the trial of tirzepatide, which has a conversion equation to ""thrice-daily."" This chain of relationships suggests that the DV_STAT of Fig 2A is ultimately related to tirzepatide and its dosing frequency."
12,How many patients did not experience ?1 serious adverse event in the Tirzepatide 15mg group?,Hard,221,Table 3,"Based on the graph data provided, there is no direct link or information given about the number of patients who did not experience serious adverse events in the Tirzepatide 15mg group. The graph mainly shows relationships and comparisons between different medications, dosages, and study parameters. Therefore, without specific data on adverse events in the Tirzepatide 15mg group, it is not possible to determine the exact number of patients who did not experience serious adverse events in that group."
13,What is the mean insulin glargine dose at week 52?,Hard,"(geometric mean daily insulinglargine dose at week 52: pooled tirzepatide,13IU[0.15IU/kg]; 5-mg tirzepatide, 20IU [0.24IU/kg];10-mg tirzepatide, 12IU[0.15IU/kg]; 15-mg tirz epatide, 8IU[0.10IU/kg])",In Results part ( Additional Secondary and Exploratory End points). Below the graph,"To determine the mean insulin glargine dose at week 52, we need to follow the connections in the graph data provided. 

Starting with the information given, we see that insulin lispro is involved in a sponsored study and is compared with 4 IU. This comparison is related to the dose prior to the 3 largest meals of the day, which is similar to a dose taken twice weekly. This dose frequency is supervised on a weekly basis, which is also similar to glycemic control. Glycemic control predisposes to a once-weekly dose, which occurred during a trial involving tirzepatide. Tirzepatide is converted to a thrice-daily dose.

Based on this information, we do not have a direct connection to the mean insulin glargine dose at week 52. The data provided primarily focuses on insulin lispro and its dosing regimen, rather than insulin glargine. Therefore, without additional information or a direct link to the mean insulin glargine dose at week 52, we cannot accurately determine this value from the given graph data."
14,"What is the percentage of participants included in the study from the White race and other races, respectively, in the 5mg Tirzepatide group (White race + Other race should sum up to 100)?",Hard,94.7 + 5.3 (White + Other races),Table 1,"To determine the percentage of participants included in the study from the White race and other races in the 5mg Tirzepatide group, we need more specific data related to race demographics of the participants in the study. The graph data provided does not contain information directly related to race demographics.

Without specific data on the racial composition of the participants in the 5mg Tirzepatide group, it is not possible to calculate the percentage of participants from the White race and other races in that group. Additional information on the demographics of the study participants would be needed to accurately answer the question."
15,What are the other anti-diabetic medications used with Tirzepatide in this study?,Hard,"Metformin, Insulin Glargine, Insulin Lispro",Table 1,"The other anti-diabetic medications used with Tirzepatide in this study are Insulin lispro and 4 IU. Insulin lispro was involved in the study and compared with the administration prior to the 3 largest meals of the day. This administration was found to be similar to a twice-weekly schedule, which was supervised weekly for glycemic control. This glycemic control predisposed to once-weekly administration, which occurred during the trial with Tirzepatide. Additionally, there was a conversion equation from Tirzepatide to a thrice-daily administration."
