Anderson 1 Published online: 6 April 2018 /C211The Author(s) 2018 Abstract Background Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, has been co-formulated with the absorption enhancer sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC) as a tablet for oral administra- tion. This trial (NCT02014259) investigated the pharma- cokinetics, safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide in subjects with and without renal impairment. Methods Subjects were categorised as having normal renal function ( n = 24), mild ( n = 12), moderate ( n = 12) or severe ( n = 12) renal impairment, or end-stage renal dis- ease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis ( n = 11) and received once-daily oral semaglutide (5 mg for 5 days followed by 10 mg for 5 days) in the fasting state, followed by 30 min fasting after dosing. Semaglutide plasma con- centrations were measured during dosing and for up to 21 days after the last dose. Results Semaglutide exposure (area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to 24 h after the tenth dose and maximum concentration after the tenth dose) did not vary in a consistent pattern across the renal function groups. Similarly, there was no apparent effect of renal impairment on the semaglutide half-life (geometric mean range 152–165 h). Except for one subject in the ESRD group, semaglutide was not detected in urine. Haemodialysis did not affect the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Adverse events were in line with those observed for other GLP-1 receptor agonists and no safety concerns were identiﬁed. Conclusion There was no apparent effect of renal impair- ment or haemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide. Based on this trial, renal impairment should not affect dose recommendations for oral semaglutide. Key Points Renal impairment did not appear to impact the pharmacokinetic properties of oral semaglutide following ten consecutive once-daily doses. Oral semaglutide was well-tolerated in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment. These data suggest that renal impairment should not affect the dosing recommendations of oral semaglutide. 1 Introduction Renal impairment is a frequent co-morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and can affect the metabolism and excretion of antidiabetic medications [ 1]. Altered pharmacokinetic properties of antidiabetic drugs in sub- jects with renal impairment may lead to an increased risk of adverse effects [ 2]. Hence, some antidiabetic medica- tions are contraindicated or should be used with caution in this population, leading to more limited treatment options in renally impaired patients with type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) ana- logue in late-stage clinical development for the treatment & Charlotte Granhall cogr@novonordisk.com 1 Novo Nordisk A/S, Vandta˚rnsvej 108-110, 2860 Søborg, Denmark Clin Pharmacokinet (2018) 57:1571–1580 https://doi.org/10.1007/s40262-018-0649-2of type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide has 94% sequence homology to native human GLP-1 [ 3]. Structural differ- ences between native GLP-1 and semaglutide include amino acid substitutions at position 8 (alanine to a- aminoisobutyric acid) and position 34 (lysine to arginine), and acylation of the lysine in position 26 with a spacer and C-18 fatty diacid chain [ 4]. The substitution at position 8 renders semaglutide less susceptible to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), while the lysine acylation improves binding to albumin [ 4]. In phase III trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous administration of semaglutide has been shown to signiﬁ- cantly improve glycaemic control and reduce body weight compared with placebo when given as monotherapy, and compared with sitagliptin, extended-release exenatide or insulin glargine when given as add-on therapy to oral antidiabetic drugs [ 5–8]. Treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide has also been associated with a reduced incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk [ 9]. An oral formulation of semaglutide may lead to earlier initiation of treatment and may improve acceptance and adherence for some patients. However, peptide-based drugs, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, typically have very low bioavailability when orally administered due to extensive degradation by proteolytic enzymes and poor absorption across the gastrointestinal mucosa [ 10, 11]. To achieve adequate bioavailability after oral administration, co-formulation with an absorption enhancer is necessary. Oral semaglutide is being developed as a co-formulation with the absorption enhancer sodiumN-(8-[2-hydroxy- benzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC). The mode of action of SNAC involves a localised increase in pH that protects semaglutide against proteolytic degradation and facilitates the absorption of semaglutide across the gastric epithelium [12, 13]. Once-daily oral semaglutide resulted in better glycaemic control and greater reductions in body weight than placebo in a 26-week phase II dose–response study in patients with type 2 diabetes [ 14]. Semaglutide is metabolised by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential b-oxidation of the fatty acid side chain. As semaglutide is not cleared by a speciﬁc organ, the impact of reduced renal function on its pharmacokinetics is expected to be limited, as supported by the previous observation that the pharmacokinetics and safety of subcutaneous semaglutide was not affected by renal impairment [ 15]. However, these data may not pre- dict the impact of potentially altered gastrointestinal physiology due to renal impairment on the pharmacoki- netics, safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide. Renal impairment could affect pathways of gut drug metabolism and can be associated with other changes, such as changes in absorption, plasma protein binding, transport and tissue distribution. Further, the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SNAC is unknown. The aim of this trial was to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and toler- ability of oral semaglutide in subjects with renal impair- ment compared to those with normal renal function. 2 Patients and Methods Male or female subjects were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they were aged 18–85 years with body mass index 18.5–40.0 kg/m2. Subjects with renal impairment were categorised according to their estimated creatinine clear- ance at screening. Clearance of creatinine was estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula [ 16] and was based on age, weight, serum creatinine and sex, and adjusted to body surface area calculated by the Dubois and Dubois formula [17]: mild impairment (60–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2), moderate impairment (30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and severe impair- ment (15–29 mL/min/1.73 m 2). The end-stage renal dis- ease (ESRD) group included subjects with renal disease requiring haemodialysis. Subjects with normal renal func- tion were judged to be of general good health by the investigator based on medical history, physical examina- tion, vital signs and laboratory safety tests. In line with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines for studies in sub- jects with renal impairment [18, 19], the aim was to recruit normal and impaired renal function groups which were comparable with respect to sex, age and body weight as far as was possible. Key exclusion criteria for all subjects included previous renal transplantation; peritoneal dialysis; Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis or other inﬂammatory bowel disease; chronic pancreatitis or idiopathic acute pancreatitis; per- sonal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome; serious cardiac disease (New York Heart Association heart failure functional class III or IV; myocardial infarction within 3 months; unstable angina pectoris); uncontrolled hyper- tension (diastolic blood pressure C 100 mmHg or systolic blood pressure C 180 mmHg); current hepatic dysfunction or severe hepatic disease; and chronic malabsorption. Subjects with renal impairment using agents known to alter tubular secretion of creatinine (e.g. cimetidine, trimetho- prim) were also excluded. Concomitant use of lipid-low- ering agents, anti-hypertensive agents and platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as aspirin, was permitted. Subjects with diabetes, other than those being treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors, could be enrolled in the renally impaired groups. All subjects provided written, informed consent. Rele- vant Ethics Committees approved the protocol and the trial 1572 C. Granhall et al.was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki and FDA/EMA guidelines for studies in subjects with renal impairment [ 18, 19]. 2.1 Trial Design This was a multicentre, open-label, multiple-dose, parallel- group trial (NCT02014259). All subjects were treated with oral semaglutide (Novo Nordisk A/S, Søborg, Denmark) for 10 consecutive days, with dose escalation to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects: 5 days of semaglutide 5 mg followed by 5 days of semaglutide 10 mg (Fig.1). Oral semaglutide tablets included 300 mg of SNAC. The 10-day dosing regimen was chosen to avoid subjects with all measured concentrations below the lower limit of quantiﬁcation (LLOQ) and to reduce the variability observed in exposure after a single dose [ 20]. Subjects received a single tablet of oral semaglutide with 120 mL of water in the morning after overnight fasting (C 6 h), with no ﬂuid intake for C 2 h before dosing. Subjects had no food or liquid intake for 30 min after dosing, after which a standardised breakfast was started. Administration of oral concomitant medication was avoided within ± 2h o f dosing. During the dosing period, haemodialysis sessions in subjects with ESRD (three times per week) were started immediately after semaglutide administration. Haemodial- ysis was performed at two trial sites; the haemodialyser used was either a Fresenius Medical Care (Bad Homburg, Germany) machine or B Braun (Hessen, Germany) Dialog/C210machine using Xevonta low ﬂux membrane (Lo 15) or high ﬂux membrane (Hi 15 or Hi 18). The blood ﬂow rate was 500–600 mL/min and the ultraﬁltration rate was 0–23 mL/min. Blood samples for determination of semaglutide con- centration in plasma were drawn pre-dose and at frequent timepoints until 504 h (21 days) after the last dosing. Blood samples for analysis of plasma concentrations of SNAC were collected at additional timepoints within the ﬁrst 24 h after the last dosing to account for the shorter half-life of SNAC. Additional samples pre- and post-dial- ysis were collected to determine semaglutide and SNAC concentrations in subjects with ESRD; samples were also collected to determine SNAC concentrations during dial- ysis on day 9. 2.1.1 Semaglutide Plasma Bioanalysis Venous blood samples were drawn in K 3EDTA tubes and stored at - 20 /C176C until analysed. A liquid chromatogra- phy–tandem mass spectroscopy (LC–MS/MS) assay was used following precipitation of the plasma proteins (Cele- rion Switzerland AG, Fehraltorf, Switzerland). The LC– MS/MS assay was validated according to current guideli- nes for bioanalysis of plasma samples in the concentration range 0.729–60.8 nmol/L (3.00–250 ng/mL). A ﬁvefold dilution of each sample was validated to extend the assay range above 60.8 nmol/L. A stable isotope-labelled ana- logue of semaglutide was used as an internal standard (IS). The analysis was carried out using an AB Sciex API QTrap/C2105500 mass spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Positive ions were monitored in the multiple reac- tion-monitoring (MRM) mode with mass transitions m/ z 1029.1 ? 136.0 Da (semaglutide) and m/z 1033.2 ? 136.0 Da (IS). The LC system was a Waters Acquity UPLC/C210system and the LC column an Acquity UPLC /C210 BEH300 C18, 2.1 9 50 mm (Waters, Elstree, UK). Quantiﬁcation was performed by peak area ratios of semaglutide versus IS. The calibration curve ﬁtting was done by weighted linear regression (1/concentration2). The lower LLOQ for semaglutide was 0.729 nmol/L.

A LC–MS/MS assay was used following in-line solid-phase sample preparation (Celerion Switzerland AG, Fehraltorf, Switzerland). The LC–MS/MS assay was validated according to current guidelines for bioanalysis of plasma samples in the con- centration range 5.00–2000 ng/mL. A ﬁvefold dilution of each sample was validated to extend the assay range above 2000 ng/mL. A structural analogue of SNAC was used as an IS. The analysis was carried out using an AB SCIEX API 4000TM Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Negative ions were monitored in the MRM mode with mass transitions m/ z 278.1 ? 118.0 Da (SNAC) and m/z 249.0 ? 135.0 Da (IS). The LC system was a Cohesive Turbulent Flow sys- tem with LC loading column TurboFlow TM Cyclone-P, 50 9 0.5 mm (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) and analytical column Onyx TM Monolithic C18, 50 9 2.0 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Quan- tiﬁcation was performed using the peak area ratios of SNAC versus IS. The calibration curve ﬁtting was done by weighted linear regression (1/concentration 2). The LLOQ for SNAC was 5.00 ng/mL. Urine samples were collected from subjects producing urine pre-dose on day 1 and on days 10–11 with fraction- ated urine collection in predeﬁned intervals after dosing. 2.1.3 Semaglutide and SNAC Urine Bioanalysis Urine samples were stored at - 20 /C176C until analysed. To avoid non-speciﬁc binding of semaglutide to urine collec- tion containers, 1% Triton TM X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added to the urine samples in a ratio of 1 part per 9 parts urine. LC–MS/MS assays identical to the above for plasma were used for analysing urine samples for semaglutide and SNAC. The assay ranges and the LLOQ were identical to those in plasma but due to dilution with Triton X-100, the assay ranges were corrected for dilution (correction factor 1.111). SNAC metabolites were also analysed (data not reported). 2.2 Trial Endpoints and Statistical Analysis Sample size was calculated based on the precision of the ratio of the area under the semaglutide plasma concentra- tion–time curve (AUC) from time zero to 24 h after the tenth dose (AUC 24,Day10) between the group of subjects with normal renal function and any one of the groups of subjects with renal impairment. The between-subject standard deviation of log(AUC 24,Day10) used in the sample size calculation was 0.60. Twenty-two subjects with evaluable pharmacokinetic proﬁles in the normal renal function group and 11 in each of the renal impairment groups provided at least 80% probability of achieving a two-sided 90% conﬁdence interval (CI) for the true ratio (R) of AUC 24,Day10 between the normal renal function group and a speciﬁc renal impairment group, which was contained within the interval [0.66* ^R; 1.51* ^R] where ^R represented the estimated ratio that would be achieved in the present trial. The primary endpoint was the AUC 24,Day10. Secondary endpoints included maximum observed semaglutide plasma concentration 0–24 h after the tenth dose ( Cmax,Day10), time to Cmax,Day10 (tmax,Day10), renal clearance of semaglutide (based on 0–36 h after the tenth dose) (CL R) and terminal half-life of semaglutide after the tenth dose ( t/C145,Day10). Analyses of pharmacokinetic endpoints were based on the full analysis set, which consisted of all subjects who were exposed to at least one dose of trial product. AUC24,Day10 was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method based on observed values and actual sampling times. Cmax,Day10 and tmax,Day10 were derived from the observed pharmacokinetic proﬁles. t/C145,Day 10 was calculated as ln(2)/ kz, where the terminal elimination rate constant ( kz) was estimated by log-linear regression on the terminal part of the pharmacokinetic proﬁles. AUC24,Day10 and Cmax,Day10 were compared between the normal renal function group and each of the four groups of subjects with renal impairment using a linear normal model with log-transformed endpoint as dependent variable and log (weight) and age as continuous covariates, and sex and renal function group as categorical ﬁxed effects. The model included data from all four renal impairment groups as well as the group with normal renal function and allowed for different variations in each of these ﬁve groups. Estimated differences in log-transformed values between the group with normal renal function and each of the four groups with renal impairment were back-transformed to the original scale. For each parameter, the results were pre- sented as the estimated ratios with the corresponding 90% CIs. This was done with an equivalence approach in mind; however, the CIs were not expected to lie within any speciﬁc no-effect boundaries due to the large variability seen with oral semaglutide. In subjects with ESRD, the ratio of the observed AUC of semaglutide from 144 to 148 h during haemodialysis (day 16) over the predicted AUC of semaglutide from 144 to 148 h (AUC144–148 h,dial /AUC144–148 h,pred ) was calculated using the terminal elimination rate ( kz) (as estimated using the semaglutide plasma concentrations between two haemodialysis sessions at 76, 96, 120 and 144 h) after the tenth dosing. 1574 C. Granhall et al.Pharmacokinetic endpoints were also calculated based on estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) using the Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation [21]. Endpoints derived for SNAC included AUC 24,Day10, Cmax,Day10, tmax,Day10 and CLR. In addition, in subjects with ESRD, the area under the SNAC plasma concentration– time curve from time zero to 4 h (AUC 4) after dosing was calculated during haemodialysis on day 9 and with no haemodialysis on day 10 and these were compared using a linear normal model with log-transformed endpoint as dependent variable and haemodialysis (yes/no) and subject as ﬁxed factors. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS/C210version 9.3 or 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Safety and tolerability were assessed through reported adverse events (AEs), hypoglycaemic episodes (deﬁned as conﬁrmed if the episode was severe according to the American Diabetes Association [ADA], i.e. requiring third- party assistance [22], or veriﬁed by a plasma glucose level of \ 3.1 mmol/L [ B 56 mg/dL]), laboratory safety vari- ables, physical examination, vital signs and electrocardiogram. 3 Results 3.1 Subjects A total of 71 subjects received oral semaglutide, all of whom completed the trial and were included in the full analysis and safety analysis sets. Of those entering the trial, 24 subjects had normal renal function, 12 subjects each had mild, moderate or severe renal impairment based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula, and 11 had ESRD. Twelve sub- jects had type 2 diabetes and two had type 1 diabetes; of these, eight were being treated with insulin analogues and six with oral antidiabetic drugs. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are summarised in Table 1. 3.2 Pharmacokinetics Geometric mean concentration–time proﬁles of semaglu- tide after the tenth dose by renal function group are shown in Fig. 2. There was no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in semaglutide exposure (AUC 24,Day10 and Cmax,Day10) by renal function group on day 10 (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Compared to the group with normal renal function, the mean exposure of semaglutide appeared to be higher in the group with mild renal impairment (estimated ratio: AUC24,Day10 1.37 [90% CI 0.91–2.06] and Cmax,Day10 1.39 [0.93–2.06]), whereas lower exposure was observed in the group with severe renal impairment (estimated ratio: AUC24,Day10 0.61 [90% CI 0.42–0.88] and Cmax,Day10 0.61 [0.42–0.87]). Semaglutide exposure was similar for the groups with moderate renal impairment and normal renal Table 1 Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics Parameters Renal function group (full analysis set) Normal (n = 24) Mild (n = 12) Moderate (n = 12) Severe (n = 12) ESRD (n = 11) Age (years) [mean (SD)] 52 (8) 57 (13) 59 (11) 57 (12) 54 (13) Sex, male [ n (%)] 15 (62.5) 5 (41.7) 9 (75.0) 9 (75.0) 7 (63.6) Weight (kg) [mean (SD)] 84.9 (12.9) 83.4 (19.5) 87.2 (15.8) 85.5 (12.2) 75.0 (15.3) Body mass index (kg/m 2) [mean (SD)] 28.4 (3.9) 29.0 (5.5) 30.1 (5.2) 28.5 (3.9) 26.9 (5.3) HbA1c (%) [mean (SD)] 5.5 (0.3) 5.9 (0.7) 6.0 (0.8) 6.1 (0.6) 6.2 (1.3) Creatinine clearance (mL/min/1.73 m 2) [mean (range)] 107 (90–132) 71 (60–89) 47 (34–56) 18 (15–27) 11 (9–14) Subjects with diabetes [ n (%)] 0 2 (16.7) 3 (25.0) 5 (41.7) 4 (36.4) ESRD end-stage renal disease, HbA1c glycosylated haemoglobin, SD standard deviation 0 04 321 42216 5 10 15 20 Time since last dosing (hours) Semaglutide plasma concentration (nmol/L) SevereNormal End stage Reference line for lower limit of quantification (0.729 nmol/L) Mild Moderate Fig. 2 Geometric mean concentration–time proﬁles of semaglutide after the tenth dose by renal function.

No consistent or clinically relevant pattern of increase or decrease in semaglutide exposure was observed when subjects were categorised into renal function groups by eGFR based on MDRD, with similar exposure in all groups with the exception of higher apparent mean expo- sure in the moderately renally impaired group (data not shown). The median tmax,Day10 for semaglutide was similar across all groups and ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 h (Table 2). The geometric mean for t/C145,Day10 appeared to increase slightly from 152 h in subjects with normal renal function to 165 h in those with severe renal impairment, but was similar in the ESRD group and normal renal function group (Table2). Semaglutide was not generally detected in urine samples except in one subject in the ESRD group (who had a very low urine volume) and therefore CL R was not assessed. Mean concentration–time proﬁles of SNAC after the tenth dose by renal function group are shown in Fig. 4 with pharmacokinetic parameters presented in Table 3. The AUC24,Day 10 of SNAC increased with increasing degree of renal impairment, except for in the ESRD group. The estimated ratio of the AUC 24,Day10 in each of the renal impairment groups to that in the group with normal renal function was 1.19 (90% CI 1.01–1.42) for subjects with mild renal impairment, 1.30 (90% CI 1.08–1.57) with moderate renal impairment, 1.49 (90% CI 1.26–1.75) with severe renal impairment and 1.32 (90% CI 1.13–1.55) with ESRD. TheCmax,Day10 of SNAC showed no consistent pattern with increasing renal impairment: the estimated ratio compared with normal renal function was 0.94 (90% CI 0.63–1.41) in subjects with mild renal impairment, 0.70 (90% CI 0.45–1.10) with moderate renal impairment, 1.06 (90% CI 0.64–1.75) with severe renal impairment and 0.79 (90% CI 0.51–1.22) with ESRD. The median time to reach the maximum concentration ( tmax) after the tenth dosing was similar across the renal function groups and ranged from 0.58 to 0.83 h, while a clear terminal phase was not observed for SNAC and the half-life ( t/C145) could not be estimated. The CL R of SNAC based on 0–36 h after the tenth dosing decreased with severe renal impairment.

Granhall et al.Regarding pharmacokinetic endpoints in subjects with ESRD, haemodialysis did not appear to affect exposure of semaglutide, since AUC 144–148 h,dial /AUC144–148 h,pred was close to 1 (estimated ratio: 0.97, 95% CI 0.92–1.01). For SNAC, exposure was compared between a dialysis and non-dialysis day. The estimated ratio of the AUC 4 of SNAC on day 9 during haemodialysis to the AUC 4 of SNAC on day 10 was 0.95 (95% CI 0.74–1.23). These data suggest that haemodialysis did not affect either semaglu- tide or SNAC exposure. 3.3 Safety and Tolerability Across all renal function groups, 25 subjects (35.2%) reported a total of 53 AEs (Table 4). The proportion of subjects with AEs was higher in the groups with renal impairment (25.0–58.3%) than in the group with normal renal function (20.8%); however, the overall occurrence of AEs did not increase with increasing renal impairment. The majority of AEs were mild (48 events in 23 subjects); four subjects reported ﬁve moderate AEs, while none were severe. There were no serious AEs, no deaths and no AEs leading to trial withdrawal. The most frequently reported AEs were gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal distension, vomiting, nausea and abdominal discomfort). Hypoglycaemia conﬁrmed by plasma glucose concen- tration of \ 3.1 mmol/L ( \ 56 mg/dL) was reported by two subjects (one episode each), both of whom had dia- betes; one in the moderate renal impairment group treated with sulphonylureas and one in the ESRD group treated with insulin (Table 4). Documented symptomatic hypo- glycaemia (according to ADA classiﬁcation) [ 22] was also low (three subjects [ﬁve events] in the moderate renal impairment group and two subjects [two events] in the severe renal impairment group). No severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported. There was an increase in the mean pulse rate at the end of treatment in all of the renal function groups but there was no trend towards a greater increase with increasing degree of renal impairment. There were no clinically rel- evant changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, physical examination or electrocardiogram. There were minor increases in mean lipase values in all renal function groups but mean values did not increase with decreasing renal function. 4 Discussion Overall, no consistent or clinically relevant pattern of increase or decrease in semaglutide exposure (AUC from time zero to 24 h [AUC24] and maximum concentration [Cmax]) between subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment and normal renal function was observed after 10 consecutive days of once-daily oral administration. This is largely consistent with previous studies that have sug- gested that impaired renal function has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of other GLP-1 receptor agonists [ 23–27].

This indicates that the administration form for semaglutide does not affect the pharmacokinetics in subjects with renal impairment. The median tmax for semaglutide was also similar across renal function groups, while t/C145appeared to increase slightly with decreasing renal function (with the exception of the ESRD group), although this was not considered clinically relevant. These data indicate that absorption of oral semaglutide across the gastric epithelium is unaffected by renal impairment and any associated changes in gas- trointestinal physiology. There was limited or no excretion of semaglutide via urine, with semaglutide only detected in the urine of one subject in the ESRD group. This is in line with data after subcutaneous administration which showed that intact semaglutide in urine accounted for 3.1% of the administered dose in humans, less than 1% in rats and was not detected in the urine in monkeys [ 28]. Consistent with observations in subjects with mild-to- severe renal impairment, there appeared to be no effect on semaglutide exposure in subjects requiring haemodialysis. The lack of an effect of ESRD on the pharmacokinetics of GLP-1 analogues is in line with previous results with subcutaneous semaglutide in healthy subjects [ 15], as well as liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD [29]. Regarding the impact of renal impairment on the phar- macokinetics of SNAC, AUC 24,Day10 increased with increasing impairment, except for in the ESRD group, while Cmax,Day10 revealed no consistent pattern in relation to renal function. As SNAC is an absorption enhancer with no anticipated systemic pharmacodynamic effects, the increased exposure observed (for AUC 24,Day10) was not considered clinically relevant. However, there are no published data on the long-term safety of SNAC in subjects with renal impairment. A decrease in CL R was observed with increasing renal impairment; however, no accumula- tion of SNAC was seen. Furthermore, the estimated ratio of the AUC 4 for SNAC during haemodialysis to not during haemodialysis was close to 1. Previous phase I studies have reported that GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy is well-tolerated in patients with renal impairment [15, 23]. Similarly, in the current trial, oral semaglutide was well-tolerated with no trend towards an increase in the proportion of subjects with AEs with increasing degree of renal impairment, which is in line with the lack of a consistent effect of renal dysfunction on semaglutide exposure. The most frequently reported AEs in all groups were gastrointestinal disorders, which are con- sidered a class effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Most gastrointestinal AEs were mild in severity. No severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported and conﬁrmed hypoglycaemia occurred rarely, consistent with the glu- cose-dependent mode of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists [30], with no apparent increase with decreasing renal function. These ﬁndings are consistent with results from larger trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists [ 31, 32].

Severe hypoglycaemia was deﬁned as an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates or glucagon or take other corrective actions. Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia was deﬁned as an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration B 3.9 mmol/L ( B 70 mg/dL). Conﬁrmed hypoglycaemia was deﬁned as severe according to the ADA classiﬁ- cation and/or biochemically conﬁrmed by a plasma glucose value of \ 3.1 mmol/L ( B 56 mg/dL), with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia 1578 C. Granhall et al.instance, in the 26-week LIRA-RENAL study of 279 patients with moderate renal impairment, liraglutide did not affect renal function; withdrawals due to gastroin- testinal AEs were higher than with placebo but with no increase in hypoglycaemia risk [32]. Minor increases in lipase levels were observed across all renal function groups, which is consistent with increases observed in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with liraglutide [33]. A limitation of the trial is the short duration, which does not permit conclusions on long-term safety. However, no unexpected safety ﬁndings were reported in a 26-week phase II trial, in which the safety proﬁle of oral semaglu- tide was comparable with subcutaneous semaglutide [14]. Previous pharmacokinetic and longer-term phase III studies with subcutaneous semaglutide have indicated a similar safety proﬁle to that of other GLP-1 receptor agonists [5–8, 15, 34]. Further long-term safety data on oral semaglutide will be provided by the ongoing PIONEER phase III clinical trial programme in a large and broad population of subjects with type 2 diabetes, which includes the PIONEER 5 trial in subjects with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment (NCT02827708). A strength of the trial is that the effect of renal impairment on pharma- cokinetics was assessed after clinic-based multiple dosing of semaglutide. Effects of renal impairment on pharma- cokinetics at steady state were not characterised, as steady state is predicted to be reached after 4–5 weeks. The sample size may appear limited at 11–12 subjects per renally impaired group. However, the number of subjects was more than double that in a comparable trial with liraglutide [29] and also had more patients with normal renal function than in the subcutaneous semaglutide trial [15]. This was to compensate for the loss in statistical power due to the higher inherent variability in semaglutide exposure when orally administered. The inconsistent pat- tern in semaglutide exposure across renal function groups can be attributed to a lack of effect of renal impairment on semaglutide exposure, as was previously observed with subcutaneous semaglutide [ 15], together with the higher intrinsic variability of orally administered semaglutide. In addition, the trial was conducted according to regulatory standards and comprised four renal impairment groups (including a group with ESRD) with more than ten subjects in each group and included a reference group with normal renal function that was comparable with respect to baseline characteristics [18, 19]. 5 Conclusion The pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide did not appear to be affected by renal impairment, including in subjects with ESRD undergoing haemodialysis. Oral semaglutide was also well-tolerated with no increase in AEs with increasing renal dysfunction. These results indicate that adjusted dosing for oral semaglutide may not be required for patients with impaired renal function.
