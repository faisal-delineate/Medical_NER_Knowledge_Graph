Bækdala, Astrid Breitschaftb, Andrea Navarriaa and Cilie W. Hansena aNovo Nordisk A/S, Søborg, Denmark;bPAREXEL International GmbH, Berlin, Germany ABSTRACT Background: Since the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 analog comprises semaglutide co-formulated with an absorption enhancer, sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate, which induces a transient, localized increase in gastric pH, we have investigated whether a proton pump inhibitor affects the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide. Research design and methods: A single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial investi- gated pharmacokinetic interactions of oral semaglutide with omeprazole (40 mg once-daily) in 54 healthy subjects. Primary endpoints were area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 24 h for semaglu- tide (AUC0−24h,semaglutide,Day10) and maximum concentration of semaglutide (Cmax,semaglutide,Day10) at day 10. Results: Exposure of semaglutide appeared to be slightly increased, although not statistically signifi- cantly, with oral semaglutide plus omeprazole versus oral semaglutide alone (AUC0−24h,semaglutide,Day10 [estimated treatment ratio 1.13; 90%CI 0.88, 1.45] and Cmax,semaglutide,Day10 [estimated treatment ratio 1.16; 90%CI 0.90, 1.49]). Gastric pH was higher with oral semaglutide and omeprazole versus oral semaglutide alone. Adverse events were mild or moderate and, most commonly, gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusions: There was a slight non-statistically significant increase in semaglutide exposure when oral semaglutide was administered with omeprazole, but this is not considered clinically relevant and no dose adjustment is likely to be required.

Introduction The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor represents a valuable target for the management of type 2 diabetes, based on its abilities to stimulate insulin, inhibit glucagon secretion in a glucose-depending manner, delay gastric emp- tying, and reduce energy intake with a low risk of hypoglyce- mia [1,2], and the potential for cardiovascular protection [3,4]. Several GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are available (lir- aglutide, lixisenatide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, and exenatide) and are administered by subcutaneous injection on a daily or weekly basis. However, oral administration of GLP-1-based therapies will provide an alternative route of delivery and greater convenience for some patients with type 2 diabetes, and thereby may help with patient acceptance and adherence. The first orally delivered GLP-1 analog in clinical develop- ment for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is based on sema- glutide, a GLP-1 analog shown to be effective at improving glycemic control, reducing body weight, and potentially pro- viding cardiovascular protection in patients with type 2 dia- betes when administered subcutaneously [ 3,5,6]. Oral semaglutide comprises a co-formulation of semaglutide with the absorption enhancer, sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxylbenzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC), in a tablet [7]. The mode of action of SNAC involves a buffering effect that increases the local pH, protecting semaglutide against proteolytic degradation and facilitating the highly localized absorption of semaglutide across gastric mucosa in a concentration-dependent manner via effects on transcellular pathways [8,9]. In a phase 2 dosage- finding trial in 632 patients with type 2 diabetes, once-daily oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control and greater weight loss than placebo over 26 weeks [7]. As the enhanced absorption of semaglutide is facilitated by SNAC in a pH-dependent manner, it is important to determine if treatments that change gastric pH influence the effects of SNAC and thereby alter the exposure to semaglutide. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a commonly used approach to alleviate symptoms of various gastrointestinal comorbidities in patients with type 2 diabetes. These agents act by inhibiting the acid pump in parietal cells of the stomach to increase gastric pH [10], with the largest decreases in acid secretion occurring around 2 h after administration [11,12]. The inhibi- tory effect on acid secretion increases with repeated once- daily dosing, reaching a plateau after 4 days [12]. The current trial was conducted in order to investigate whether administration of the commonly prescribed PPI, ome- prazole, affects the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral semaglutide. CONTACT Tine A.

Patients and methods An independent ethics committee, Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin, approved the protocol. All subjects pro- vided written, informed consent. The trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/ European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines for drug-drug interaction studies [13,14]. 2.1. Trial population Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 75 years and with a body mass index of 20.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 were eligible to participate if they were in good general health, based on medical history, physical examination, and assessment of vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory safety tests. Key exclusion criteria included a history, or presence, of can- cer, diabetes, or any clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocri- nological, hematological, dermatological, venereal, neurologi- cal, psychiatric diseases, or other major disorder; previous gastrointestinal surgery; history of Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or other inflammatory bowel disease (full eligibility criteria are listed in Supplementary Online Material). Prescription or non-prescription medicinal or herbal products were not allowed within 3 weeks before or during the trial, other than the use of contraceptives, occasional use of para- cetamol (up to 3000 mg daily [3 × 1000 mg]), and use of local anesthetics for gastric pH measurement procedures. 2.2. Trial design This was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial (NCT02249871) conducted at a single site (Early Phase Clinical Unit, PAREXEL International GmbH, Berlin, Germany) between September 2014 and April 2015. Subjects were stra- tified by sex and randomized (1:1) to oral semaglutide once- daily (5 mg for 5 days, followed by 10 mg for 5 days), either with or without concomitant administration of omeprazole 40 mg gastro-resistant capsules once-daily (Figure 1) using randomization lists. The 10-day dosing regimen was chosen to avoid subjects with semaglutide exposure below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and reduce the variability observed in exposure after a single dose [15]. In addition, the multiple dose regimen ensured a maximal effect on acid secretion. After oral administration of omeprazole, the onset of the anti-secretory effect occurs within 1 h, with the maximum effect from 2 h after dosing [12]. To investigate the exposure of semaglutide and SNAC at the time of the expected max- imum effect of omeprazole on gastric pH, oral semaglutide was dosed 2 h after intake of omeprazole in the current trial. Both trial products were administered with 120 mL of water. In subjects not receiving omeprazole, 120 mL of water was given alone 2 h before semaglutide administration. Subjects did not consume food or liquid other than water 6 h prior to dosing of semaglutide. No water intake was permitted in the 2 h before dosing of semaglutide. Subjects were not permitted food or liquid intake for 30 min after dosing of oral semaglutide, after which a meal was served. Blood samples were drawn into K3EDTA tubes pre-dose on day 1, and at set time points on days 9 and 10, for determination of plasma semaglutide and SNAC concentra- tions (see Supplementary Online Material for exact timings), and stored at – 20°C until analyzed. To determine plasma semaglutide concentrations, a liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) assay was used following precipitation of the plasma proteins (vali- dated according to current guidelines for bioanalysis of plasma samples in the concentration range 0.729 to 60.8 nmol/L [3.00 to 250 ng/mL], including extension of the assay range 5-fold by dilution) (Celerion Switzerland AG, Fehraltorf, Switzerland). A stable isotope-labeled analog of semaglutide was used as an internal standard. The analysis was conducted using an AB SCIEX API QTRAP® 5500 mass spectrometer and positive ions were monitored in the multi- ple reaction-monitoring mode with mass transitions m/z 1029.1→136.0 Da (semaglutide) and m/z 1033.2 →136.0 Da (internal standard). The liquid chromatography (LC) system was a Waters ACQUITY UPLC System and the LC column an ACQUITY UPLC BEH300 C18, 2.1 × 50 mm. Quantification was performed by peak area ratios of semaglutide compared to the internal standard. The calibration curve was fitted by a Figure 1. Trial design. PK, pharmacokinetics. 870 T. A. BÆKDAL ET AL.weighted linear regression (1/concentration2). The LLOQ for semaglutide was 0.729 nmol/L (see Supplementary Online Material for rules on imputation of values below the LLOQ). For the bioanalysis of SNAC, an LC-MS/MS assay was used following in-line solid-phase sample preparation (validated according to current guidelines for bioanalysis of plasma sam- ples in the concentration range 5.00 to 2000 ng/mL, including extension of the assay range 5-fold by dilution) (Celerion Switzerland AG, Fehraltorf, Switzerland). A structural analog of SNAC was used as an internal standard. The analysis was conducted using an AB SCIEX API 4000TM Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer and negative ions monitored in the MRM mode with mass transitions m/z 278.1→118.0 Da (SNAC) and m/z 249.0→135.0 Da (internal standard). The LC system was a Cohesive Turbulent Flow system with LC loading column, Turboflow Cyclone-P, 50 × 0.5 mm, and analytical column OnyxTM Monolithic C18, 50 × 2.0 mm. Quantification was performed using the peak area ratios of SNAC compared to the internal standard. The calibration curve was fitted by a weighted linear regression (1/concentration2). The LLOQ for SNAC was 5.00 ng/mL (see Supplementary Online Material for rules on imputation of values below the LLOQ). Omeprazole is completely metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP), particularly CYP2C19, and CYP2C19 is also inhibited by omeprazole [16]. CYP2C19 genotyping was con- ducted on blood samples, using validated sequencing assays and the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer or PGM Ion TorrentTM (Life Technologies). Gastric pH measurements were performed on day−1 and day 9 (to prevent the pH measurement procedure from influ- encing semaglutide absorption and exposure on day 10 [pri- mary endpoint timepoint]). A pH catheter was inserted into the stomach via a nostril and the ZepHr ® Impedance/pH Reflux Monitoring System was used. The pH measurements were started at the time of omeprazole dosing (day 9, oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group) or at least 5 min before intake of 120 mL water in patients not receiving omeprazole (day – 1 and day 9; oral semaglutide group), and pH measure- ments were recorded every 5 s for 5 h. 2.3. Sample size and statistical methods The sample size was based on the precision of the ratio for the primary endpoint, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for semaglutide from time 0 to 24 h after the 10th dosing (AUC0−24h,semaglutide,Day10), between the two treatment groups using a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) derived from the t-distribution. With 24 evaluable profiles at end of treatment in each of the groups, assuming a standard devia- tion for log (AUC0−24h,semaglutide,Day10) of 0.6 and no difference between males and females, there was at least 80% probabil- ity to get a 95%CI for the ratio R of AUC0– 24h,semaglutide,Day10 between the two treatment groups within (0.68*R; 1.46*R). Assuming a withdrawal rate of 10%, 54 subjects were planned for randomization (27 per group). The primary endpoint, AUC 0−24h,semaglutide,Day10, was log- transformed and analyzed (SAS version 9.3) using an analysis of variance model with treatment group (two levels) and sex as fixed factors. This analysis was based on the full analysis set, which was defined as subjects who were randomized and exposed. The mean difference in log-transformed AUC0−24h, semaglutide,Day10 between the two groups was estimated and back-transformed to the original scale and presented as a ratio together with the corresponding two-sided 90%CI. The secondary endpoint of maximum observed plasma concentration for semaglutide after the 10th dosing (Cmax,sema- glutide,Day10) was analyzed similarly. Time to maximum sema- glutide concentration (tmax,semaglutide,Day10) and half-life of oral semaglutide (t ½,semaglutide,Day10) were summarized using descriptive statistics. Relationships between three gastric pH parameters and the PK of semaglutide and SNAC were also explored. The area under the pH measurements-time curve from 0 to 3 h after the 9th daily dose of oral semaglutide divided by the actual time interval during which pH measurements were being taken (AUC0– 3h,pH,Day9/time) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The maximum observed pH measure- ment 0 to 3 h after the 9th oral semaglutide dose (pHmax, Day9) was derived as the maximum of all valid pH measure- ments within the time frame. The incremental area under the pH measurement-time curve from 0 to 3 h after the 9th oral semaglutide dose divided by the actual time interval during which pH measurements were being taken (iAUC0– 3h,pH,Day9/ time) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method as the area under the pH measurement-time curve that is above the pre-dose pH average, taken as the average of pH values 5 min up to dosing at nominal time– 2 h in relation to the 9th dose. Safety was evaluated in all subjects who were exposed to at least one dose of trial product (safety analysis set). Safety was assessed by the number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), number of hypoglycemic episodes, changes in laboratory safety variables, physical examination, vital signs, and electrocardiogram. 3. Results In total, 114 subjects were screened, and 54 subjects were randomized and exposed to trial products (Figure 2). Of these subjects, 53 completed the trial; one subject withdrew due to a TEAE (acute tonsillitis). All 54 subjects were included in the full analysis and safety analysis set. Demographic and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the subjects was 52 years in the oral semaglutide group and 59 years in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group. There were no apparent differences in other baseline characteristics between treatment groups. Two subjects in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group were poor metabolizers with regards to CYP2C19 phenotyping, while all other subjects were extensive metabolizers. 3.1. Semaglutide pharmacokinetics The geometric mean concentration-time profiles of semaglu- tide for one dosing interval (24 h) after the 10th dose are shown in Figure 3(a). Exposure to semaglutide after the 10th dose (AUC0– 24h,semaglutide,Day10) appeared to be slightly higher EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG METABOLISM & TOXICOLOGY 871in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group compared with oral semaglutide alone; however, the increase was not statis- tically significant (estimated treatment ratio 1.13; 90%CI 0.88, 1.45) (Figure 3(b)). Similarly, Cmax,semaglutide,Day10 appeared to be slightly higher with oral semaglutide plus omeprazole compared with oral semaglutide alone, but the difference was not statistically significant (Figure 3(b)). Median tmax,sema- glutide,Day10 was the same in subjects receiving oral semaglu- tide plus omeprazole and in those receiving oral semaglutide alone (1.0 h for both groups) (Table 2). In addition, t½ for semaglutide was similar in subjects treated with oral semaglu- tide plus omeprazole (geometric mean of 156 h) and those treated with oral semaglutide alone (150 h) (Table 2). Results for semaglutide PK parameters after the 9th dosing (Supplemental Table S1) at the time of gastric pH measure- ment were consistent with results obtained after the 10 th dosing, the time of primary PK endpoint assessment. 3.2. SNAC pharmacokinetics As shown inFigure 4(a), the pattern of exposure to SNAC was similar in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group com- pared with oral semaglutide alone after the 10 th dosing (Figure 4(a)). The AUC0– 24h,SNAC,Day10 of SNAC appeared to be slightly higher in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group compared with oral semaglutide alone (estimated treatment ratio 1.14; 90%CI 1.02, 1.27) (Figure 4(b)). The maximum expo- sure of SNAC (Cmax,SNAC,Day10) was similar and not significantly different between the two groups (estimated treatment ratio 0.96; 90%CI 0.72, 1.29) (Figure 4(b)). The median tmax,SNAC,Day10 for SNAC after the 10th daily dose was similar between the groups (0.7 h with oral semaglu- tide and 0.6 h with oral semaglutide plus omeprazole) Figure 2. Subject flow.

A. BÆKDAL ET AL.(Table 2). No clear terminal phase was observed for SNAC; hence, t½ could not be estimated. However, the mean con- centration of SNAC in plasma had declined to less than LLOQ in most patients within 24 h, indicating fast elimination. Results for SNAC PK parameters after the 9 th dosing (Supplemental Table S1) were consistent with results obtained after the 10th dosing. 3.3. Effects on gastric pH parameters Overall, an increase in gastric pH was observed on day 9 in subjects in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group com- pared to the oral semaglutide alone group. The means of AUC0– 3h,pH,Day9/time, iAUC 0– 3h,pH,Day9/time, and pH max,Day9 appeared higher in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group compared with the oral semaglutide alone group (Table 3). Scatter plots presenting the association of semaglutide exposure (AUC0– 24h,Day9) and the gastric pH parameters did not indicate any pattern or relationship (linear or non-linear) between treatments (Supplemental Figure S1). The two CYP2C19 poor metabolizers w ere distributed across the plot similarly to the extensive metabolizers, without display- ing any specific pattern. In exploratory analyses, there were no statistically significant associations between AUC0– 24h or Cmax (day 9 and 10) for semaglutide and the gastric pH parameters measured (Suppl emental Table S2). Scatter plots presenting the association of SNAC exposure (AUC 0– 24h,Day9) and the gastric pH parameters did not appear to show a specific pattern (Su pplemental Figure S2). In exploratory analyses, the estimates of coefficients were posi- tive and there was a significant association between Cmax of Figure 3.

There were no other statistically sig- nificant associations between AUC 0– 24h or Cmax (day 9 and 10) for SNAC and the gastric pH parameters measured (Supplemental Table S3). 3.4. Safety and tolerability A total of 74 TEAEs were reported by 27 subjects (50%) across the two treatment groups (39 events in 17 subjects in the oral semaglutide group and 35 events in 10 subjects in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group). All of the TEAEs were mild (62 events) or moderate (12 events) in severity and all were reported as recovered. The most frequently reported TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (29 events in 17 sub- jects), including nausea and abdominal distension, followed by metabolism and nutrition disorders (12 events in 12 subjects), particularly decreased appetite (Supplemental Table S4). One subject treated with oral semaglutide alone withdrew due to a non-serious TEAE (acute tonsillitis). No serious TEAEs or deaths were reported. No medical events of special interest (pancrea- tic neoplasms, pancreatitis or clinical suspicion of pancreatitis, or medication errors concerning trial products) were reported. Table 2.

Pulse rate increased comparably in both treatment groups and changes were not considered clinically relevant at an individual level. 4. Discussion To facilitate absorption upon oral administration, semaglutide has been co-formulated with SNAC, which induces a localized, transi- ent increase in gastric pH, protecting semaglutide from proteolytic degradation and enhancing absorption [8,9]. Few drug-drug inter- action studies have previously been published with omeprazole and other GLP-1RAs due to their subcutaneous administration. However, due to the mechanism of action of SNAC in oral sema- glutide, the present trial was conducted to investigate the poten- tial influence of omeprazole-mediated gastric pH increase on the systemic exposure of semaglutide and SNAC. As expected, gastric pH increased with omeprazole admin- istration. Omeprazole administration appeared to have no substantial impact on the exposure of SNAC. The AUC0– 24h, Day10 of SNAC was 14% higher in the oral semaglutide plus omeprazole group compared with semaglutide alone, although Cmax and tmax for SNAC were similar between the groups. Omeprazole treatment was associated with a slight but not statistically significant increase in exposure to sema- glutide (AUC0– 24h,Day10 and Cmax,Day10) versus oral semaglutide taken alone. Furthermore, median tmax and t½ appeared simi- lar in subjects treated with oral semaglutide plus omeprazole and those treated with oral semaglutide alone. The slight, apparent increase in exposure to semaglutide with omepra- zole was not considered to be clinically relevant, as semaglu- tide has a broad therapeutic index and the change was well within the margins defined by the FDA and EMA for moderate inhibition [13,14]. Data from the phase 2 study, where oral semaglutide from 2.5 mg to 40 mg once-daily was studied, indicate that oral semaglutide is clinically effective and well tolerated in a broad range of doses and exposures [7] and, as such, slight increases in exposure are unlikely to affect the clinical outcomes or safety profile of oral semaglutide in patients treated with a PPI. Gastric pH reaches its lowest levels during fasting (pH 1– 2) and highest after food intake (up to pH 4), with omeprazole increasing both the fasting and fed gastric pH levels [17,18]. To maximize the inhibition of proton pumps on gastric parietal cells, and thus the inhibitory effects on acid secretion, PPIs are typically taken 20– 30 min before meals. However, while this dosing might result in a maximal clinical anti-secretory effect, the purpose of this trial was to test the effect of an increased pH. Thus, in the present trial, omeprazole was dosed 2 h before oral semaglutide so that the time of oral semaglutide tablet disintegration coincided with the expected peak anti-secretory effect of omeprazole. Although this regimen might not be representative of omeprazole and oral semaglutide dosing in clinical practice, which is a potential limita- tion of our trial, the dosing schedule was selected to reflect a worst-case scenario that produced the potential maximum effect of omeprazole on the PK of oral semaglutide. We also selected a relatively high dose of omeprazole 40 mg/day, which is indicated for the treatment of gastric ulcers [12]. Thus, administration of omeprazole to a different schedule or dose with oral semaglutide in real life is unlikely to influence semaglutide exposure to a greater degree than that reported here. In the present trial, omeprazole was administered with 120 mL of water. Although the potential effect of this water consumption on semaglutide exposure was not compared with a complete fasting state, a previous study had indicated that semaglutide exposure was not significantly affected by water volume [19]. Omeprazole inhibits its own CYP2C19-mediated metabo- lism and poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 have been shown to have higher gastric pH after treatment with omeprazole com- pared to extensive metabolizers [20]. In the present trial, there appeared to be no association between gastric pH, exposure to semaglutide, and CYP2C19 metabolizer status. Limitations of the current trial include that any direct effects of omeprazole on the pharmacodynamics of oral s e m a g l u t i d ew e r en o te l u c i d a ted. Another possible limita- tion is the open-label design; however, the design is in line with FDA and EMA guidelines on drug-drug interaction studies [13,14]. The open-label design is unlikely to have affected interpretation of PK endpoints, especially with all doses being administered on site, although this could have influenced the reporting of adverse events. Nevertheless, the safety profile of oral semaglutide was consistent with trials assessing oral and subcutaneous semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes [ 5– 7,21– 24]a n dd i dn o t appear to be affected by omeprazole co-administration. The most frequently reported TEAEs with semaglutide were gastrointestinal disorders, which are considered a class effect of GLP-1RAs. No serious TEAEs, deaths, or hypo- glycemic episodes were reported. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, there was a slight non-statistically significant increase in semaglutide exposure when oral semaglutide was administered with omeprazole at the time of maximum anti- secretory effect. This is considered non-clinically relevant and, Table 3. Gastric pH parameters after the 9th dosing.

EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG METABOLISM & TOXICOLOGY 875as such, no dose adjustment of oral semaglutide is likely to be required when administered with omeprazole.
