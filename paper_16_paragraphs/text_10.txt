Blood samples for analysis of plasma concentrations of SNAC were collected at additional timepoints within the ﬁrst 24 h after the last dosing to account for the shorter half-life of SNAC. Additional samples pre- and post-dial- ysis were collected to determine semaglutide and SNAC concentrations in subjects with ESRD; samples were also collected to determine SNAC concentrations during dial- ysis on day 9. 2.1.1 Semaglutide Plasma Bioanalysis Venous blood samples were drawn in K 3EDTA tubes and stored at - 20 /C176C until analysed. A liquid chromatogra- phy–tandem mass spectroscopy (LC–MS/MS) assay was used following precipitation of the plasma proteins (Cele- rion Switzerland AG, Fehraltorf, Switzerland). The LC– MS/MS assay was validated according to current guideli- nes for bioanalysis of plasma samples in the concentration range 0.729–60.8 nmol/L (3.00–250 ng/mL).
