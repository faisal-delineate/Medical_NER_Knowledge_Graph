The between-subject standard deviation of log(AUC 24,Day10) used in the sample size calculation was 0.60. Twenty-two subjects with evaluable pharmacokinetic proﬁles in the normal renal function group and 11 in each of the renal impairment groups provided at least 80% probability of achieving a two-sided 90% conﬁdence interval (CI) for the true ratio (R) of AUC 24,Day10 between the normal renal function group and a speciﬁc renal impairment group, which was contained within the interval [0.66* ^R; 1.51* ^R] where ^R represented the estimated ratio that would be achieved in the present trial. The primary endpoint was the AUC 24,Day10. Secondary endpoints included maximum observed semaglutide plasma concentration 0–24 h after the tenth dose ( Cmax,Day10), time to Cmax,Day10 (tmax,Day10), renal clearance of semaglutide (based on 0–36 h after the tenth dose) (CL R) and terminal half-life of semaglutide after the tenth dose ( t/C145,Day10). Analyses of pharmacokinetic endpoints were based on the full analysis set, which consisted of all subjects who were exposed to at least one dose of trial product.
