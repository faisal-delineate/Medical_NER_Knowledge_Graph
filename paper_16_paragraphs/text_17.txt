All statistical analyses were performed using SAS/C210version 9.3 or 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Safety and tolerability were assessed through reported adverse events (AEs), hypoglycaemic episodes (deﬁned as conﬁrmed if the episode was severe according to the American Diabetes Association [ADA], i.e. requiring third- party assistance [22], or veriﬁed by a plasma glucose level of \ 3.1 mmol/L [ B 56 mg/dL]), laboratory safety vari- ables, physical examination, vital signs and electrocardiogram. 3 Results 3.1 Subjects A total of 71 subjects received oral semaglutide, all of whom completed the trial and were included in the full analysis and safety analysis sets. Of those entering the trial, 24 subjects had normal renal function, 12 subjects each had mild, moderate or severe renal impairment based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula, and 11 had ESRD. Twelve sub- jects had type 2 diabetes and two had type 1 diabetes; of these, eight were being treated with insulin analogues and six with oral antidiabetic drugs. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are summarised in Table 1. 3.2 Pharmacokinetics Geometric mean concentration–time proﬁles of semaglu- tide after the tenth dose by renal function group are shown in Fig. 2. There was no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in semaglutide exposure (AUC 24,Day10 and Cmax,Day10) by renal function group on day 10 (Table 2 and Fig. 3).
