Full analysis set Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Oral Semaglutide in Renal Impairment 1575function. No consistent or clinically relevant pattern of increase or decrease in semaglutide exposure was observed when subjects were categorised into renal function groups by eGFR based on MDRD, with similar exposure in all groups with the exception of higher apparent mean expo- sure in the moderately renally impaired group (data not shown). The median tmax,Day10 for semaglutide was similar across all groups and ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 h (Table 2). The geometric mean for t/C145,Day10 appeared to increase slightly from 152 h in subjects with normal renal function to 165 h in those with severe renal impairment, but was similar in the ESRD group and normal renal function group (Table2). Semaglutide was not generally detected in urine samples except in one subject in the ESRD group (who had a very low urine volume) and therefore CL R was not assessed.
