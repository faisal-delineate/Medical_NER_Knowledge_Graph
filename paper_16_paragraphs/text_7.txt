In line with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines for studies in sub- jects with renal impairment [18, 19], the aim was to recruit normal and impaired renal function groups which were comparable with respect to sex, age and body weight as far as was possible. Key exclusion criteria for all subjects included previous renal transplantation; peritoneal dialysis; Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis or other inﬂammatory bowel disease; chronic pancreatitis or idiopathic acute pancreatitis; per- sonal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome; serious cardiac disease (New York Heart Association heart failure functional class III or IV; myocardial infarction within 3 months; unstable angina pectoris); uncontrolled hyper- tension (diastolic blood pressure C 100 mmHg or systolic blood pressure C 180 mmHg); current hepatic dysfunction or severe hepatic disease; and chronic malabsorption. Subjects with renal impairment using agents known to alter tubular secretion of creatinine (e.g. cimetidine, trimetho- prim) were also excluded.
