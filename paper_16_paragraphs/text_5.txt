To achieve adequate bioavailability after oral administration, co-formulation with an absorption enhancer is necessary. Oral semaglutide is being developed as a co-formulation with the absorption enhancer sodiumN-(8-[2-hydroxy- benzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC). The mode of action of SNAC involves a localised increase in pH that protects semaglutide against proteolytic degradation and facilitates the absorption of semaglutide across the gastric epithelium [12, 13]. Once-daily oral semaglutide resulted in better glycaemic control and greater reductions in body weight than placebo in a 26-week phase II dose–response study in patients with type 2 diabetes [ 14]. Semaglutide is metabolised by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential b-oxidation of the fatty acid side chain. As semaglutide is not cleared by a speciﬁc organ, the impact of reduced renal function on its pharmacokinetics is expected to be limited, as supported by the previous observation that the pharmacokinetics and safety of subcutaneous semaglutide was not affected by renal impairment [ 15]. However, these data may not pre- dict the impact of potentially altered gastrointestinal physiology due to renal impairment on the pharmacoki- netics, safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide.
