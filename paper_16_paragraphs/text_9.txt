Subjects received a single tablet of oral semaglutide with 120 mL of water in the morning after overnight fasting (C 6 h), with no ﬂuid intake for C 2 h before dosing. Subjects had no food or liquid intake for 30 min after dosing, after which a standardised breakfast was started. Administration of oral concomitant medication was avoided within ± 2h o f dosing. During the dosing period, haemodialysis sessions in subjects with ESRD (three times per week) were started immediately after semaglutide administration. Haemodial- ysis was performed at two trial sites; the haemodialyser used was either a Fresenius Medical Care (Bad Homburg, Germany) machine or B Braun (Hessen, Germany) Dialog/C210machine using Xevonta low ﬂux membrane (Lo 15) or high ﬂux membrane (Hi 15 or Hi 18). The blood ﬂow rate was 500–600 mL/min and the ultraﬁltration rate was 0–23 mL/min. Blood samples for determination of semaglutide con- centration in plasma were drawn pre-dose and at frequent timepoints until 504 h (21 days) after the last dosing.
