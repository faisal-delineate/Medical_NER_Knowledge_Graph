Full analysis set. Bars are estimated means and 95% conﬁdence intervals. Treatment comparisons show esti- mated treatment ratio and 90% conﬁdence interval. AUC24,Day10 area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 0 to 24 h after the tenth dose, CLR renal clearance, Cmax,Day10 maximum plasma concentration 0–24 h after the tenth dose, ESRD end-stage renal disease 1576 C. Granhall et al.Regarding pharmacokinetic endpoints in subjects with ESRD, haemodialysis did not appear to affect exposure of semaglutide, since AUC 144–148 h,dial /AUC144–148 h,pred was close to 1 (estimated ratio: 0.97, 95% CI 0.92–1.01). For SNAC, exposure was compared between a dialysis and non-dialysis day. The estimated ratio of the AUC 4 of SNAC on day 9 during haemodialysis to the AUC 4 of SNAC on day 10 was 0.95 (95% CI 0.74–1.23). These data suggest that haemodialysis did not affect either semaglu- tide or SNAC exposure. 3.3 Safety and Tolerability Across all renal function groups, 25 subjects (35.2%) reported a total of 53 AEs (Table 4).
