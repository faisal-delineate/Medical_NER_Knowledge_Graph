Compared to the group with normal renal function, the mean exposure of semaglutide appeared to be higher in the group with mild renal impairment (estimated ratio: AUC24,Day10 1.37 [90% CI 0.91–2.06] and Cmax,Day10 1.39 [0.93–2.06]), whereas lower exposure was observed in the group with severe renal impairment (estimated ratio: AUC24,Day10 0.61 [90% CI 0.42–0.88] and Cmax,Day10 0.61 [0.42–0.87]).
