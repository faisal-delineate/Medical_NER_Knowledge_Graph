The inconsistent pat- tern in semaglutide exposure across renal function groups can be attributed to a lack of effect of renal impairment on semaglutide exposure, as was previously observed with subcutaneous semaglutide [ 15], together with the higher intrinsic variability of orally administered semaglutide. In addition, the trial was conducted according to regulatory standards and comprised four renal impairment groups (including a group with ESRD) with more than ten subjects in each group and included a reference group with normal renal function that was comparable with respect to baseline characteristics [18, 19]. 5 Conclusion The pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide did not appear to be affected by renal impairment, including in subjects with ESRD undergoing haemodialysis. Oral semaglutide was also well-tolerated with no increase in AEs with increasing renal dysfunction. These results indicate that adjusted dosing for oral semaglutide may not be required for patients with impaired renal function.
