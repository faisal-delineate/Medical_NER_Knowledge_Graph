Mean concentration–time proﬁles of SNAC after the tenth dose by renal function group are shown in Fig. 4 with pharmacokinetic parameters presented in Table 3. The AUC24,Day 10 of SNAC increased with increasing degree of renal impairment, except for in the ESRD group. The estimated ratio of the AUC 24,Day10 in each of the renal impairment groups to that in the group with normal renal function was 1.19 (90% CI 1.01–1.42) for subjects with mild renal impairment, 1.30 (90% CI 1.08–1.57) with moderate renal impairment, 1.49 (90% CI 1.26–1.75) with severe renal impairment and 1.32 (90% CI 1.13–1.55) with ESRD. TheCmax,Day10 of SNAC showed no consistent pattern with increasing renal impairment: the estimated ratio compared with normal renal function was 0.94 (90% CI 0.63–1.41) in subjects with mild renal impairment, 0.70 (90% CI 0.45–1.10) with moderate renal impairment, 1.06 (90% CI 0.64–1.75) with severe renal impairment and 0.79 (90% CI 0.51–1.22) with ESRD. The median time to reach the maximum concentration ( tmax) after the tenth dosing was similar across the renal function groups and ranged from 0.58 to 0.83 h, while a clear terminal phase was not observed for SNAC and the half-life ( t/C145) could not be estimated.
