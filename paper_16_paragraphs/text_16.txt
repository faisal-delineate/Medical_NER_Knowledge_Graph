For each parameter, the results were pre- sented as the estimated ratios with the corresponding 90% CIs. This was done with an equivalence approach in mind; however, the CIs were not expected to lie within any speciﬁc no-effect boundaries due to the large variability seen with oral semaglutide. In subjects with ESRD, the ratio of the observed AUC of semaglutide from 144 to 148 h during haemodialysis (day 16) over the predicted AUC of semaglutide from 144 to 148 h (AUC144–148 h,dial /AUC144–148 h,pred ) was calculated using the terminal elimination rate ( kz) (as estimated using the semaglutide plasma concentrations between two haemodialysis sessions at 76, 96, 120 and 144 h) after the tenth dosing. 1574 C. Granhall et al.Pharmacokinetic endpoints were also calculated based on estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) using the Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation [21]. Endpoints derived for SNAC included AUC 24,Day10, Cmax,Day10, tmax,Day10 and CLR. In addition, in subjects with ESRD, the area under the SNAC plasma concentration– time curve from time zero to 4 h (AUC 4) after dosing was calculated during haemodialysis on day 9 and with no haemodialysis on day 10 and these were compared using a linear normal model with log-transformed endpoint as dependent variable and haemodialysis (yes/no) and subject as ﬁxed factors.
