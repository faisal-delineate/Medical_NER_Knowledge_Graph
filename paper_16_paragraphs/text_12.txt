A LC–MS/MS assay was used following in-line solid-phase sample preparation (Celerion Switzerland AG, Fehraltorf, Switzerland). The LC–MS/MS assay was validated according to current guidelines for bioanalysis of plasma samples in the con- centration range 5.00–2000 ng/mL. A ﬁvefold dilution of each sample was validated to extend the assay range above 2000 ng/mL. A structural analogue of SNAC was used as an IS. The analysis was carried out using an AB SCIEX API 4000TM Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Negative ions were monitored in the MRM mode with mass transitions m/ z 278.1 ? 118.0 Da (SNAC) and m/z 249.0 ? 135.0 Da (IS). The LC system was a Cohesive Turbulent Flow sys- tem with LC loading column TurboFlow TM Cyclone-P, 50 9 0.5 mm (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) and analytical column Onyx TM Monolithic C18, 50 9 2.0 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Quan- tiﬁcation was performed using the peak area ratios of SNAC versus IS. The calibration curve ﬁtting was done by weighted linear regression (1/concentration 2). The LLOQ for SNAC was 5.00 ng/mL. Urine samples were collected from subjects producing urine pre-dose on day 1 and on days 10–11 with fraction- ated urine collection in predeﬁned intervals after dosing. 2.1.3 Semaglutide and SNAC Urine Bioanalysis Urine samples were stored at - 20 /C176C until analysed.
