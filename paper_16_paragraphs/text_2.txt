Semaglutide plasma con- centrations were measured during dosing and for up to 21 days after the last dose. Results Semaglutide exposure (area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to 24 h after the tenth dose and maximum concentration after the tenth dose) did not vary in a consistent pattern across the renal function groups. Similarly, there was no apparent effect of renal impairment on the semaglutide half-life (geometric mean range 152–165 h). Except for one subject in the ESRD group, semaglutide was not detected in urine. Haemodialysis did not affect the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Adverse events were in line with those observed for other GLP-1 receptor agonists and no safety concerns were identiﬁed. Conclusion There was no apparent effect of renal impair- ment or haemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide. Based on this trial, renal impairment should not affect dose recommendations for oral semaglutide. Key Points Renal impairment did not appear to impact the pharmacokinetic properties of oral semaglutide following ten consecutive once-daily doses. Oral semaglutide was well-tolerated in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment.
