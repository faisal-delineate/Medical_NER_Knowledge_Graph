The proportion of subjects with AEs was higher in the groups with renal impairment (25.0–58.3%) than in the group with normal renal function (20.8%); however, the overall occurrence of AEs did not increase with increasing renal impairment. The majority of AEs were mild (48 events in 23 subjects); four subjects reported ﬁve moderate AEs, while none were severe. There were no serious AEs, no deaths and no AEs leading to trial withdrawal. The most frequently reported AEs were gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal distension, vomiting, nausea and abdominal discomfort). Hypoglycaemia conﬁrmed by plasma glucose concen- tration of \ 3.1 mmol/L ( \ 56 mg/dL) was reported by two subjects (one episode each), both of whom had dia- betes; one in the moderate renal impairment group treated with sulphonylureas and one in the ESRD group treated with insulin (Table 4). Documented symptomatic hypo- glycaemia (according to ADA classiﬁcation) [ 22] was also low (three subjects [ﬁve events] in the moderate renal impairment group and two subjects [two events] in the severe renal impairment group). No severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported. There was an increase in the mean pulse rate at the end of treatment in all of the renal function groups but there was no trend towards a greater increase with increasing degree of renal impairment.
