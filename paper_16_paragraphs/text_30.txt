Previous pharmacokinetic and longer-term phase III studies with subcutaneous semaglutide have indicated a similar safety proﬁle to that of other GLP-1 receptor agonists [5–8, 15, 34]. Further long-term safety data on oral semaglutide will be provided by the ongoing PIONEER phase III clinical trial programme in a large and broad population of subjects with type 2 diabetes, which includes the PIONEER 5 trial in subjects with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment (NCT02827708). A strength of the trial is that the effect of renal impairment on pharma- cokinetics was assessed after clinic-based multiple dosing of semaglutide. Effects of renal impairment on pharma- cokinetics at steady state were not characterised, as steady state is predicted to be reached after 4–5 weeks. The sample size may appear limited at 11–12 subjects per renally impaired group. However, the number of subjects was more than double that in a comparable trial with liraglutide [29] and also had more patients with normal renal function than in the subcutaneous semaglutide trial [15]. This was to compensate for the loss in statistical power due to the higher inherent variability in semaglutide exposure when orally administered.
