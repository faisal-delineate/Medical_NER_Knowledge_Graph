The most frequently reported AEs in all groups were gastrointestinal disorders, which are con- sidered a class effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Most gastrointestinal AEs were mild in severity. No severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported and conﬁrmed hypoglycaemia occurred rarely, consistent with the glu- cose-dependent mode of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists [30], with no apparent increase with decreasing renal function. These ﬁndings are consistent with results from larger trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists [ 31, 32].
