Concomitant use of lipid-low- ering agents, anti-hypertensive agents and platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as aspirin, was permitted. Subjects with diabetes, other than those being treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors, could be enrolled in the renally impaired groups. All subjects provided written, informed consent. Rele- vant Ethics Committees approved the protocol and the trial 1572 C. Granhall et al.was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki and FDA/EMA guidelines for studies in subjects with renal impairment [ 18, 19]. 2.1 Trial Design This was a multicentre, open-label, multiple-dose, parallel- group trial (NCT02014259). All subjects were treated with oral semaglutide (Novo Nordisk A/S, Søborg, Denmark) for 10 consecutive days, with dose escalation to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects: 5 days of semaglutide 5 mg followed by 5 days of semaglutide 10 mg (Fig.1). Oral semaglutide tablets included 300 mg of SNAC. The 10-day dosing regimen was chosen to avoid subjects with all measured concentrations below the lower limit of quantiﬁcation (LLOQ) and to reduce the variability observed in exposure after a single dose [ 20].
