These data suggest that renal impairment should not affect the dosing recommendations of oral semaglutide. 1 Introduction Renal impairment is a frequent co-morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and can affect the metabolism and excretion of antidiabetic medications [ 1]. Altered pharmacokinetic properties of antidiabetic drugs in sub- jects with renal impairment may lead to an increased risk of adverse effects [ 2]. Hence, some antidiabetic medica- tions are contraindicated or should be used with caution in this population, leading to more limited treatment options in renally impaired patients with type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) ana- logue in late-stage clinical development for the treatment & Charlotte Granhall cogr@novonordisk.com 1 Novo Nordisk A/S, Vandta˚rnsvej 108-110, 2860 Søborg, Denmark Clin Pharmacokinet (2018) 57:1571–1580 https://doi.org/10.1007/s40262-018-0649-2of type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide has 94% sequence homology to native human GLP-1 [ 3]. Structural differ- ences between native GLP-1 and semaglutide include amino acid substitutions at position 8 (alanine to a- aminoisobutyric acid) and position 34 (lysine to arginine), and acylation of the lysine in position 26 with a spacer and C-18 fatty diacid chain [ 4].
