This indicates that the administration form for semaglutide does not affect the pharmacokinetics in subjects with renal impairment. The median tmax for semaglutide was also similar across renal function groups, while t/C145appeared to increase slightly with decreasing renal function (with the exception of the ESRD group), although this was not considered clinically relevant. These data indicate that absorption of oral semaglutide across the gastric epithelium is unaffected by renal impairment and any associated changes in gas- trointestinal physiology. There was limited or no excretion of semaglutide via urine, with semaglutide only detected in the urine of one subject in the ESRD group. This is in line with data after subcutaneous administration which showed that intact semaglutide in urine accounted for 3.1% of the administered dose in humans, less than 1% in rats and was not detected in the urine in monkeys [ 28]. Consistent with observations in subjects with mild-to- severe renal impairment, there appeared to be no effect on semaglutide exposure in subjects requiring haemodialysis. The lack of an effect of ESRD on the pharmacokinetics of GLP-1 analogues is in line with previous results with subcutaneous semaglutide in healthy subjects [ 15], as well as liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD [29].
