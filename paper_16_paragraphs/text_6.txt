Renal impairment could affect pathways of gut drug metabolism and can be associated with other changes, such as changes in absorption, plasma protein binding, transport and tissue distribution. Further, the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SNAC is unknown. The aim of this trial was to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and toler- ability of oral semaglutide in subjects with renal impair- ment compared to those with normal renal function. 2 Patients and Methods Male or female subjects were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they were aged 18–85 years with body mass index 18.5–40.0 kg/m2. Subjects with renal impairment were categorised according to their estimated creatinine clear- ance at screening. Clearance of creatinine was estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula [ 16] and was based on age, weight, serum creatinine and sex, and adjusted to body surface area calculated by the Dubois and Dubois formula [17]: mild impairment (60–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2), moderate impairment (30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and severe impair- ment (15–29 mL/min/1.73 m 2). The end-stage renal dis- ease (ESRD) group included subjects with renal disease requiring haemodialysis. Subjects with normal renal func- tion were judged to be of general good health by the investigator based on medical history, physical examina- tion, vital signs and laboratory safety tests.
