There were no clinically rel- evant changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, physical examination or electrocardiogram. There were minor increases in mean lipase values in all renal function groups but mean values did not increase with decreasing renal function. 4 Discussion Overall, no consistent or clinically relevant pattern of increase or decrease in semaglutide exposure (AUC from time zero to 24 h [AUC24] and maximum concentration [Cmax]) between subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment and normal renal function was observed after 10 consecutive days of once-daily oral administration. This is largely consistent with previous studies that have sug- gested that impaired renal function has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of other GLP-1 receptor agonists [ 23–27]. Importantly, this trial is also in line with the corresponding study for subcutaneous 0 250 750 04 3216 57 8 1 0 1 2 1 8 2 4 Reference line for lower limit of quantification (5 ng/mL) 500 1000 1250 Time since last dosing (hours) SNAC (ng/mL) SevereNormal Mild Moderate ESRD Fig. 4 Mean concentration–time proﬁles of SNAC after the tenth dose by renal function.
