Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia was deﬁned as an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration B 3.9 mmol/L ( B 70 mg/dL). Conﬁrmed hypoglycaemia was deﬁned as severe according to the ADA classiﬁ- cation and/or biochemically conﬁrmed by a plasma glucose value of \ 3.1 mmol/L ( B 56 mg/dL), with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia 1578 C. Granhall et al.instance, in the 26-week LIRA-RENAL study of 279 patients with moderate renal impairment, liraglutide did not affect renal function; withdrawals due to gastroin- testinal AEs were higher than with placebo but with no increase in hypoglycaemia risk [32]. Minor increases in lipase levels were observed across all renal function groups, which is consistent with increases observed in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with liraglutide [33]. A limitation of the trial is the short duration, which does not permit conclusions on long-term safety. However, no unexpected safety ﬁndings were reported in a 26-week phase II trial, in which the safety proﬁle of oral semaglu- tide was comparable with subcutaneous semaglutide [14].
