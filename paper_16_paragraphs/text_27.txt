Regarding the impact of renal impairment on the phar- macokinetics of SNAC, AUC 24,Day10 increased with increasing impairment, except for in the ESRD group, while Cmax,Day10 revealed no consistent pattern in relation to renal function. As SNAC is an absorption enhancer with no anticipated systemic pharmacodynamic effects, the increased exposure observed (for AUC 24,Day10) was not considered clinically relevant. However, there are no published data on the long-term safety of SNAC in subjects with renal impairment. A decrease in CL R was observed with increasing renal impairment; however, no accumula- tion of SNAC was seen. Furthermore, the estimated ratio of the AUC 4 for SNAC during haemodialysis to not during haemodialysis was close to 1. Previous phase I studies have reported that GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy is well-tolerated in patients with renal impairment [15, 23]. Similarly, in the current trial, oral semaglutide was well-tolerated with no trend towards an increase in the proportion of subjects with AEs with increasing degree of renal impairment, which is in line with the lack of a consistent effect of renal dysfunction on semaglutide exposure.
