To avoid non-speciﬁc binding of semaglutide to urine collec- tion containers, 1% Triton TM X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added to the urine samples in a ratio of 1 part per 9 parts urine. LC–MS/MS assays identical to the above for plasma were used for analysing urine samples for semaglutide and SNAC. The assay ranges and the LLOQ were identical to those in plasma but due to dilution with Triton X-100, the assay ranges were corrected for dilution (correction factor 1.111). SNAC metabolites were also analysed (data not reported). 2.2 Trial Endpoints and Statistical Analysis Sample size was calculated based on the precision of the ratio of the area under the semaglutide plasma concentra- tion–time curve (AUC) from time zero to 24 h after the tenth dose (AUC 24,Day10) between the group of subjects with normal renal function and any one of the groups of subjects with renal impairment.
