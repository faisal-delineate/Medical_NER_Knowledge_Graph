The substitution at position 8 renders semaglutide less susceptible to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), while the lysine acylation improves binding to albumin [ 4]. In phase III trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous administration of semaglutide has been shown to signiﬁ- cantly improve glycaemic control and reduce body weight compared with placebo when given as monotherapy, and compared with sitagliptin, extended-release exenatide or insulin glargine when given as add-on therapy to oral antidiabetic drugs [ 5–8]. Treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide has also been associated with a reduced incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk [ 9]. An oral formulation of semaglutide may lead to earlier initiation of treatment and may improve acceptance and adherence for some patients. However, peptide-based drugs, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, typically have very low bioavailability when orally administered due to extensive degradation by proteolytic enzymes and poor absorption across the gastrointestinal mucosa [ 10, 11].
