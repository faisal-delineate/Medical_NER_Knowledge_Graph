AUC24,Day10 was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method based on observed values and actual sampling times. Cmax,Day10 and tmax,Day10 were derived from the observed pharmacokinetic proﬁles. t/C145,Day 10 was calculated as ln(2)/ kz, where the terminal elimination rate constant ( kz) was estimated by log-linear regression on the terminal part of the pharmacokinetic proﬁles. AUC24,Day10 and Cmax,Day10 were compared between the normal renal function group and each of the four groups of subjects with renal impairment using a linear normal model with log-transformed endpoint as dependent variable and log (weight) and age as continuous covariates, and sex and renal function group as categorical ﬁxed effects. The model included data from all four renal impairment groups as well as the group with normal renal function and allowed for different variations in each of these ﬁve groups. Estimated differences in log-transformed values between the group with normal renal function and each of the four groups with renal impairment were back-transformed to the original scale.
