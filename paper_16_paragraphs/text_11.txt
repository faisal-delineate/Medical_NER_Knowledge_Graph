A ﬁvefold dilution of each sample was validated to extend the assay range above 60.8 nmol/L. A stable isotope-labelled ana- logue of semaglutide was used as an internal standard (IS). The analysis was carried out using an AB Sciex API QTrap/C2105500 mass spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Positive ions were monitored in the multiple reac- tion-monitoring (MRM) mode with mass transitions m/ z 1029.1 ? 136.0 Da (semaglutide) and m/z 1033.2 ? 136.0 Da (IS). The LC system was a Waters Acquity UPLC/C210system and the LC column an Acquity UPLC /C210 BEH300 C18, 2.1 9 50 mm (Waters, Elstree, UK). Quantiﬁcation was performed by peak area ratios of semaglutide versus IS. The calibration curve ﬁtting was done by weighted linear regression (1/concentration2). The lower LLOQ for semaglutide was 0.729 nmol/L.
