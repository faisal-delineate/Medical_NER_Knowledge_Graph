ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Oral Semaglutide in Subjects with Renal Impairment Charlotte Granhall1 • Flemming L. Søndergaard 1 • Mette Thomsen1 • Thomas W. Anderson 1 Published online: 6 April 2018 /C211The Author(s) 2018 Abstract Background Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, has been co-formulated with the absorption enhancer sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC) as a tablet for oral administra- tion. This trial (NCT02014259) investigated the pharma- cokinetics, safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide in subjects with and without renal impairment. Methods Subjects were categorised as having normal renal function ( n = 24), mild ( n = 12), moderate ( n = 12) or severe ( n = 12) renal impairment, or end-stage renal dis- ease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis ( n = 11) and received once-daily oral semaglutide (5 mg for 5 days followed by 10 mg for 5 days) in the fasting state, followed by 30 min fasting after dosing.
