    "\n",
    "        ### Guidelines:\n",
    "        1. Identify relationships such as:\n",
    "        - TREATS: When an intervention (e.g., drug or procedure) is used to treat a condition.\n",
    "        - ASSOCIATED_WITH: When an entity is linked or co-occurs with another (e.g., symptoms associated with a disease).\n",
    "        - CAUSES: When one entity (e.g., risk factor) leads to another (e.g., disease).\n",
    "        - MEASURED_BY: When a measurement (e.g., biomarker or lab test) evaluates an entity.\n",
    "        - LOCATED_IN: When a geographic location is associated with an entity.\n",
    "        - FUNDED_BY: When an organization funds a study or trial.\n",
    "        - REGULATED_BY: When an entity is overseen by a regulatory body.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Use the provided entities to determine relationships based on the text context. Always provide evidence from the text supporting the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. For each relationship, include:\n",
    "        - **source**: The name of the first entity.\n",
    "        - **source_type**: The type of the first entity (e.g., Drug, Disease, Organization).\n",
    "        - **target**: The name of the second entity.\n",
    "        - **target_type**: The type of the second entity.\n",
    "        - **relationship**: The type of relationship between the two entities.\n",
    "        - **evidence**: Supporting evidence extracted directly from the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Expected Output Format:\n",
    "        Return the output in JSON format as shown below:\n",
    "        [\n",
    "            {{\n",
