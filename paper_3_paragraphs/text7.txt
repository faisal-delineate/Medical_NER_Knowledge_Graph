The median body weight and age ranges in the three hepatic impairment groups were calculated after≥5 participants in each group had been dosed. Partic- ipants with normal hepatic function were subsequently included within these ranges and with ~50% of participants on each side of the median. Exclusion criteria included: history of acute or chronic pancreati- tis; human immune-deficiency virus (HIV) positive; uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure≥ 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure≥ 100 mmHg); and any disorder, except for conditions associated with hepatic impairment in participants with impaired hepatic function, which might jeopardize the participant's safety or compliance with the protocol and/or ability to complete the trial.
