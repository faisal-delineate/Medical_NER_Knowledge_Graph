Participants remained in-house for a minimum of 5 days (120 hours) after dosing. Ambulant visits took place on days 7, 8, 15, 22 and 29, with a follow-up visit on day 36. Blood samples were taken to determine the plasma concentration profiles of semaglutide 15 minutes prior to dosing, at time zero, and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 336, 504, 672 and 840 hours (up to 35 days) after administration of semaglutide. Furthermore, a blood sample was taken on day 1 prior to dosing to assess protein binding. Also on day 1, a baseline urine sample was collected before dosing. From 24 to 72 hours after dosing, which was the time period expected to include the maximum semaglutide concentration, frac- tionated urine collections were made in predefined intervals: 24 to 36 hours (nominal time 36 hours), 36 to 48 hours (nominal time 48 hours), 48 to 60 hours (nominal time 60 hours) and 60 to JENSEN ET AL. 99972 hours (nominal time 72 hours).
