In addition, people with advanced ascites and those for whom ascites required emptying were excluded because uncertainty in the volume of distribution in these cases could have affected the trial results. Nevertheless, the trial was conducted in accordance with the regulatory guidelines for these types of trial, and a single-dose study is sufficient when the drug exhibits linear phar- macokinetics.18,19 The 0.5-mg dose was the lower of the two mainte- nance doses investigated in the semaglutide phase III trials, and was chosen to ensure optimal pharmacokinetic profiles from single dosing and also because a higher dose would not be tolerated without dose escalation. It is recognized that it might not be feasible to conduct the study in people with the condition for which the drug is under development.19 Volunteers with hepatic disease are an acceptable alternative and therefore results may not be directly applied to patients with type 2 diabetes and hepatic impairment.
