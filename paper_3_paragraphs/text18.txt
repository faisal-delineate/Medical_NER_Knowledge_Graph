A sensitivity analysis for Cmax provided a ratio closer to 1 for the severe/no hepatic impair- ment comparison, with an estimated mean ratio (90% CI) of 1.05 (0.88, 1.25; see Figure 1E for the excluded data point). tmax,t ½ and CL/F also appeared to be similar across the hepatic function groups (Table 3); no formal statistical testing was carried out. Results of the linear regression exploratory analysis of the influ- ence of the individual Child–Pugh variables on the primary endpoint AUC0-∞ as well as Cmax are given in Table 4. Non-significantP values for each analysis suggested that the individual variables did not influ- ence the AUC0-∞ or Cmax of semaglutide, supporting the earlier main results. The median fraction of unbound semaglutide was <1% across the groups (ranging from 0.13% to 0.36%), corresponding to a plasma protein binding of >99% in all participants. Semaglutide was not quantifiable in any urine sample (all results were below the lower limit of quantification) and renal clearance was therefore not estimated. 3.3 | Safety and tolerability No serious adverse events or events leading to participant with- drawal were reported in this trial. Ten participants across all groups reported 12 adverse events.
