In summary, exposure of semaglutide did not appear to be affected by hepatic impairment and the pharmacokinetic properties of semaglutide in participants with hepatic impairment were similar to those of participants with normal hepatic function. Semaglutide was well tolerated and there were no unexpected safety concerns for the use of semaglutide in participants with hepatic impairment. Taken together, the results suggest that no semaglutide dose adjustment may be necessary in people with hepatic impairment. 1004 JENSEN ET AL.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsv√¶rd, Denmark provided the trial products.
