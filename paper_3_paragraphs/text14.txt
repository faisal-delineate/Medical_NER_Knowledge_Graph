The normal hepatic function group was compared to mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment in order. The variables AUC0-last and Cmax were analysed using the same model as used for the primary endpoint. An exploratory linear regres- sion analysis was performed to examine the influence of the individ- ual Child–Pugh variables albumin (serum), total bilirubin (serum) and prothrombin time prolongation (plasma) on the primary endpoint, AUC0-∞, as well as on Cmax. In each analysis, the log-transformed parameter in question was included as an independent variable in the model. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed for Cmax, using the same model as for the primary endpoint, whereby a single sample with an unphysiologically high value was excluded from the pharmacokinetic profile. The value of t½ was determined using t½ = log(2)/λz, where λz was estimated by log-linear regression on the terminal part of the concentration-time curve.
