Semaglutide has 94% homology to native GLP-1, with structural modifications that make semaglutide less susceptible to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzymes.7 Moreover, the modifications improve the specific high- affinity binding to albumin,7 which slows down the degradation of semaglutide in plasma and results in decreased renal clearance.8 The structural modifications prolong the half-life of semaglutide to ~1 week, making it appropriate for once-weekly administration.7,9 In phase III trials, semaglutide demonstrated superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with placebo and active comparators,10–12 as well as a decrease in cardiovascular risk.13 Native GLP-1 is rapidly metabolized by enzymes such as DPP-4, which is found in many tissues and cell types.14 Clearance of native GLP-1 and its metabolites is largely mediated via the kidneys14 and, in general, GLP-1RAs require no dose adjustment for hepatic impair- ment.15 In humans, semaglutide is metabolized via proteolytic cleav- age of the peptide backbone and sequentialβ-oxidation of the fatty acid chain, with no single organ acting as the major route of elimina- tion.8 Semaglutide degradation products are excreted via urine and faeces,8 implying at least partial involvement of the liver in semaglu- tide elimination; therefore, impaired hepatic function may affect the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Moreover, semaglutide binds to albumin and the concentration of albumin may be lower in people with hepatic impairment than in those with normal hepatic function. The rationale for the present study was to provide information on whether the pharmacokinetics of a single subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide was altered to such an extent that people with impaired hepatic function should be dosed differently from those with normal hepatic function.
