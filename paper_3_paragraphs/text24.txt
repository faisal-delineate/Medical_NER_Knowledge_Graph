Three asymptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were reported by 3 partici- pants: 2 in the normal hepatic function group and 1 in the moderate hepatic impairment group. No clinically relevant changes in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse), clinical laboratory assessments, physical examination or ECG were observed in participants with normal or impaired hepatic function. 4 | DISCUSSION The present study has provided important information with respect to the use of semaglutide in people with hepatic impairment. Based on the exposure results for the primary endpoint AUC0-âˆž and sup- ported by the other pharmacokinetic measures, there appears to be no requirement for dose adjustment of semaglutide in these people. In the present trial, semaglutide was well tolerated overall and no unexpected safety issues related to treatment with a single 0.5 mg dose of semaglutide were identified. Administration of treatment in patients with hepatic impairment could cause problems if the drug is metabolized in the liver, leading to increased exposure and the potential to increase side effects.
