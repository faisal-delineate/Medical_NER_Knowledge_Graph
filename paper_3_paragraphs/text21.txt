The circled data point in E represents the outlier excluded from the sensitivity analysis for Cmax. Data are geometric means. Values below the lower limit of quantification (represented by the dotted line) were imputed 1002 JENSEN ET AL.TABLE 3 Pharmacokinetic characteristics of semaglutide in hepatic impairment groups Hepatic impairment group No impairmentn =1 8a Mild n = 8 Moderate n = 10 Severe n =7 Primary endpoint AUC0-∞, nmol×h/L Estimated mean 3026 2872 3080 2937 (95% CI) (2735, 3349) (2252, 3663) (2895, 3277) (2505, 3444) ER (90% CI) vs no impairment – 0.95 (0.77, 1.16) 1.02 (0.93, 1.12) 0.97 (0.84, 1.12) Secondary endpoints AUC0-last, nmol×h/L Estimated mean 2731 2621 2807 2539 (95% CI) (2442, 3055) (2000, 3433) (2597, 3035) (2013, 3203) ER (90% CI) vs no impairment – 0.96 (0.76, 1.20) 1.03 (0.92, 1.15) 0.93 (0.77, 1.13) Cmax, nmol/L Estimated mean 9.5 9.3 9.7 10.9 (95% CI) (8.4, 10.6) (7.2, 12.1) (8.3, 11.2) (7.9, 14.9) ER (90% CI) vs no impairmentb – 0.99 (0.80, 1.23) 1.02 (0.88, 1.18) 1.15 (0.89, 1.48) Tmax (h) Median 65.8 65.9 77.8 53.6 Range 30.0-167.5 54.4-119.8 23.8-144.1 29.9-144.9 T½ (h) Geometric mean (CV) 150 (8.7) 155 (6.0) 151 (11.2) 163 (12.3) Range 124-169 144-171 118-171 142-191 CL/F (L/h) Geometric mean (CV) 0.040 (32.8) 0.043 (29.0) 0.037 (19.0) 0.043 (10.0) Range 0.021-0.072 0.034-0.079 0.028-0.048 0.037-0.050 Abbreviations: AUC 0-∞, area under the semaglutide concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity; AUC 0-last, area under the semaglutide concentration-time curve from time 0 to last quantifiable observation; CI, confidence interval; CL/F, total apparent clearance of semaglutide, calculated as the semaglutide dose divided by AUC0-∞;C max, maximum semaglutide concentration; CV, coefficient of variation in %; ER, estimated ratio;n, number of participants with available data; tmax, time to maximum semaglutide concentration; t½, elimination half-life, determined using t½ = log (2)/λz, whereλz was estimated by log-linear regression on the terminal part of the concentration-time curve. a In the no impairment group, 1 participant withdrew consent to remain in the trial on the dosing day (after dosing) and was excluded from the analyses.
