Instead of 9 participants in each of the hepatic impairment groups, there were 8 in the mild, 10 in the moderate and 7 in the severe group, as a result of a participant with moderate hepatic impairment being miscategorized as having mild impairment (discov- ered during data review), and also difficulty in recruiting participants with severe impairment. Baseline characteristics of the trial population are included in Table 2. The groups were generally comparable with respect to age, body weight and BMI, although the proportions of men and women varied across groups. All participants were white and not of Hispanic or Latino origin. 3.2 | Pharmacokinetics Semaglutide concentration-over-time profiles are shown in Figure 1. The mean profiles (Figure 1A) showed a similar increase in plasma semaglutide concentration in all hepatic function groups after administration of a single 0.5 mg dose of semaglutide. Individual par- ticipant profiles for each hepatic function group are shown in Figure 1B–E. The estimated mean values for AUC0-∞ are shown in Table 3. The 90% CI for the estimated ratios of the mean total exposure of semaglutide between each group tested were all within the prespeci- fied interval of 0.70 to 1.43, indicating that semaglutide exposure was independent of hepatic impairment. Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints are shown in Table 3. For AUC0-last and Cmax, the 90% CI for the estimated ratios between each group indicated similar effects across hepatic function groups and supported the results for the primary endpoint.
