Results of another trial with semaglutide concluded that dose adjustment may likewise not be needed for people with renal impair- ment, as exposure was comparable to that in people with normal renal function after adjusting for specific baseline characteristics.22 Hepatic impairment is associated with decreased concentrations of albumin.25 As semaglutide is bound to albumin, an increase in the free fraction might decrease semaglutide exposure because albumin binding slows the degradation of semaglutide in plasma and results in decreased renal clearance.9 In the present trial, the fraction of protein-bound semaglutide was >99% in all participants across the hepatic function groups, indicating that the large majority of semaglu- tide molecules remained bound to albumin.
