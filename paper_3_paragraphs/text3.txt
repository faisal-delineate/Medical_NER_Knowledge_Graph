No unexpected safety or tolerability issues were observed. Conclusions: Semaglutide exposure did not appear to be affected by hepatic impairment, sug- gesting that dose adjustment may not be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. Sema- glutide was well tolerated and there were no unexpected safety issues.
