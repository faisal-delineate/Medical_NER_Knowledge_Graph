The reported amount of freely available semaglutide (<1% across groups) should be interpreted with care as the protein-binding of semaglutide was car- ried out in vitro on blood samples taken prior to dosing. Furthermore, in order to be able to measure the protein binding in vitro, the con- centration of semaglutide relative to albumin was much higher in vitro than in the participants dosed with semaglutide; in vivo, the concentration of semaglutide9,26 is very low compared with physio- logical albumin concentrations of 0.5 to 0.7 mM (> 10 000-fold lower). Limitations of the present study include the fact that there was only a single dose of treatment and also that there were not the same number of participants in each treatment group, with fewest in the severely impaired hepatic function group. The latter was the result of difficulties in recruiting participants with severe impairment. Further- more, for safety and ethical reasons, and also as per Good Clinical Practice guidelines,21 those participants with severe hepatic encepha- lopathy were excluded.
