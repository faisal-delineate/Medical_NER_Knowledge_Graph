Severe hepatic impairment = 10-15 points. 1000 JENSEN ET AL.semaglutide divided by AUC0-∞. Renal clearance was calculated as the amount excreted from 24 to 72 hours, divided by the total AUC of the compound during that period of sampling. Other secondary pharmacokinetic analyses and safety endpoints were descriptively described. SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Caro- lina) was used to perform the statistical analyses. 3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Participant characteristics Of the 65 participants screened, 44 were exposed to subcutaneous semaglutide. Of those exposed participants, 1 in the normal hepatic function group withdrew their consent to remain in the trial on day 1 after dosing and 1 in the severe hepatic impairment group was withdrawn for“other” reasons on day 22 after dosing. Hence, 42 par- ticipants completed the trial, which was conducted between August 7, 2014, and June 3, 2015. Both the safety and the full analysis sets included all 44 exposed participants.
