Aims: To investigate whether the pharmacokinetic characteristics of semaglutide were altered in people with hepatic impairment, assessed using Child–Pugh criteria, vs those with normal hepatic function. Methods:In this multicentre, open-label, parallel-group trial (sponsor Novo Nordisk, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02210871), four groups of participants with normal hepatic function (n = 19) or mild (n = 8), moderate (n = 10) or severe (n = 7) hepatic impairment received a sin- gle, subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide.
