The safety and tolerability of semaglu- tide were also assessed. 2 | METHODS 2.1 | Trial population The trial was conducted in men or women aged≥18 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 40.0 kg/m2, who provided written informed consent before starting any trial-related activities. At screening, participants were allocated into four groups: normal hepatic function; or mild; moderate; or severe hepatic impairment. Participants with hepatic impairment were those with a diagnosis of cirrhosis attributable to parenchymal liver disease, classified according to the Child–Pugh criteria,16 as indicated in Table 1. The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis attributable to parenchymal liver disease was confirmed and documented according to the participant's medical history, physi- cal examination and at least one of the following: hepatic ultrasonog- raphy, computed axial tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or liver biopsy. The hepatic impairment was to be stable, defined as no clinically significant change in disease status in the 30 days before screening, according to recent medical history. Participants were matched to the extent possible across groups with respect to age, sex and body weight.
