The LC-MS/MS assay was vali- dated according to current guidelines for analysing plasma samples in the concentration range 0.729 to 60.8 nmol/L. A 5-fold dilution of each sample was validated to extend the assay range above 60.8 nM and a semaglutide analogue was used as an internal standard. Protein binding of semaglutide was determined using surface plasmon reso- nance technology, as described elsewhere.22 The assay measured the binding of semaglutide to protein, and the fraction of unbound sema- glutide was calculated. Semaglutide in urine was measured after add- ing 1% Triton X-100 (to prevent non-specific binding of semaglutide to the container); the same assay as described above for semaglutide in plasma was subsequently used, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.810 nmol/L for semaglutide. 2.5 | Statistical analyses The trial was designed with 78% power to establish no effect on overall semaglutide exposure as measured by the primary endpoint (AUC0-âˆž) across the three hepatic impairment groups, all compared to the normal hepatic function group.
