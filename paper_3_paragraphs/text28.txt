Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide were similar in healthy individ- uals and those with type 2 diabetes in previous reports.9,26,27 Finally, semaglutide could not be quantified in urine in the present study using an LC-MS/MS assay. A study investigating the absorption, metabolism and excretion of semaglutide using radioactive-labelled compound showed that only 3.1% of the administered dose was excreted in urine as intact semaglutide8 and therefore the methodol- ogy used in the present study would most likely not be sensitive enough to detect these small amounts. In terms of safety, no new issues related to treatment with a sin- gle 0.5 mg dose of semaglutide were identified in this trial. Few adverse events were reported and no pattern in reported events was seen across hepatic function groups. Of the 3 asymptomatic hypogly- caemic episodes reported, 2 occurred in 2 participants in the normal hepatic function group, and 1 in a participant in the moderate impair- ment group, indicating no increased risk of hypoglycaemia with hepatic impairment in this trial.
