Semaglutide plasma concentrations were assessed frequently for 35 days after dosing. The primary endpoint was area under the sema- glutide plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞). No effect of hepatic impairment was declared if the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the between-group ratio (hepatic impairment/normal function) was within the interval 0.70 to 1.43. Results: Semaglutide exposure was similar across all groups, with AUC0-∞ treatment ratios for mild impairment/normal function of 0.95 (90% CI 0.77, 1.16), moderate impairment/normal function 1.02 (90% CI 0.93, 1.12), and severe impairment/normal function 0.97 (90% CI 0.84, 1.12). The maximum plasma semaglutide concentration (Cmax) did not appear to be influenced by hepatic function, with mild impairment/normal function treatment ratios of 0.99 (90% CI 0.80, 1.23), moderate impairment/normal function 1.02 (90% CI 0.88, 1.18) and severe impair- ment/normal function 1.15 (90% CI 0.89, 1.48; sensitivity analysis excluding one extreme semaglutide concentration: 1.05 [90% CI 0.88, 1.25]). In all, 10 participants reported 12 mild or moderate non-serious adverse events.
