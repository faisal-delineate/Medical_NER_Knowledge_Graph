Participants were to empty their bladders immediately before the end of a collection period. 2.3 | Pharmacokinetic and safety endpoints The primary endpoint was the area under the semaglutide plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity after a sin- gle 0.5 mg dose of semaglutide (AUC0-∞). Supportive secondary phar- macokinetic endpoints included the AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable measurement (AUC0-last), the maximum observed sema- glutide plasma concentration (Cmax), the time to Cmax (tmax), the termi- nal elimination half-life for semaglutide (t ½), the total apparent clearance of semaglutide (CL/F), the renal clearance and the fraction of unbound semaglutide. Supportive safety and tolerability endpoints included adverse events, hypoglycaemic episodes, haematology, biochemistry (includ- ing amylase and lipase), coagulation measures, calcitonin, urine analy- sis, vital signs, physical examination, ECG and fasting plasma glucose. 2.4 | Laboratory assessments Semaglutide concentrations in plasma were analysed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; Celer- ion Inc., Fehraltorf, Switzerland), as previously reported.9 Blood sam- ples were drawn and stored at−20/C14C until analysed. Prior to analysis, plasma proteins were precipitated.
