The sample size was based on a 2:1:1:1 allocation of participants with normal hepatic function and each of the three hepatic impairment groups, a true between-group ratio of 1.0 (no exposure difference) and a standard deviation on the log-scale for AUC0-∞ of 0.25.22 No effect of hepatic impairment was declared if the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the between-group ratio was within the interval 0.70 to 1.43. An overall power of 78% required a total of 45 completing participants (18:9:9:9 allocated across groups). The primary endpoint, derived from the semaglutide plasma pro- files, was the sum of the AUC from time point zero to the last quanti- fiable measurement and the AUC from the last quantifiable measurement to infinity, estimated using standard non- compartmental methods. The primary endpoint was compared among the four groups of participants using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with log-transformed AUC0-∞ as the dependent variable, age and log-transformed weight as continuous covariates, and sex and hepatic function group as categorical factors. A hierarchical test- ing scheme was prespecified to adjust the three confirmatory com- parisons for multiplicity.
